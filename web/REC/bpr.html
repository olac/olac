         <h2><A name="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction
         </h2>
         <p>This document expresses the consensus of the Open Language Archives Community on best
                        practices for describing language resources using the OLAC metadata standard
                           [<a href="#OLAC-Metadata">OLAC-Metadata</a>]. The standard itself specifies the formal constraints on the
                        syntax of valid descriptions, but does not set requirements on the content of the
                        metadata elements (beyond general conformance to the definitions of the qualified Dublin
                        Core metadata set [<a href="#DCMI">DCMI</a>]). This document provides more detailed guidance about
                        the content of specific metadata elements.
         </p>
         <p>This document does not provide a complete set of advice about what the metadata elements
                        mean or about how they should be used. Such advice is supplied in an OLAC informational
                        note [<a href="#OLAC-Usage">OLAC-Usage</a>]. This document lists the specific metadata usage guidelines
                        that have been agreed upon by the OLAC community as representing best practice. It is
                        not a requirement of participation that OLAC data providers follow these
                        recommendations. However, these recommendations are used as the standard for evaluating
                        the quality of the metadata records supplied by an OLAC data provider. 
         </p>
         <h2><A name="Recommendations"></A>2. Recommendations
         </h2>
         <p>The following are the OLAC recommendations on best practices for describing language
                        resources. Two levels of practice are distinguished: "minimal best practices" are those
                        that must be followed to attain a basic level of good quality, while "recommended best
                        practices" are those that contribute to achieving the highest quality. Follow the "more"
                        links to see the fuller treatment with definitions, usage notes, and examples in
                           [<a href="#OLAC-Usage">OLAC-Usage</a>].

               <p>In general, element properties&#8212;the labels, definitions, and range sets, should not
                                    be changed. However, two of the properties that may be changed are the font used
                                    for a specific field, and the language properties assigned to the field. This is
                                    the way that a field can be made to use a different (Unicode compliant) font and
                                    specific rules for word breaks, etc. that differ from those applied to other
                                    fields.A good candidate for customizing this way is the \title field, or the
                                    \alternative field. Keep in mind that all instances of that field will use the
                                    same font. The font should be a Unicode compliant font, not a legacy font that
                                    substitutes some characters with other characters (characters with different
                                    meanings, not just different representations). A custom font that has been
                                    developed to render Unicode characters better than or not available in generic
                                    Unicode fonts like Arial Unicode MS or Doulos SIL may be used. Be sure to document
                                    the font itself as a resource, and include it among the computer files of your
                                    collection. If these are foreign concepts, then don&#8217;t worry about this.
