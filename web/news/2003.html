<h2><a name="repositories"></a>OLAC Repositories standard adopted: [9/03]</h2>

<p> The OLAC Repositories standard has been promoted to `adopted'
status by the OLAC Council following a 9 month period of
experimentation by OLAC implementers.  This document defines the
standards OLAC archives must follow in implementing a metadata
repository.  Originally called the OLAC Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting, this document was first drafted in December 2001.  A year
later it was broadened to cover the new static repository model and
given a more general title.  Since then there have been two further
revisions in response to consultation with the community.  After a
further round of revision in consultation with the OLAC Council, the
document is now adopted as the second OLAC standard.

<h2><a name="council"></a>OLAC Council appointed: [8/03]</h2>

<p>
The OLAC Council has now been ratified by the Advisory Board.  The
council members are: Anthony Aristar (LINGUIST), Chris Cieri (LDC),
Gary Holton (ANLC), Chu-Ren Huang (Academia Sinica), Heidi Johnson
(AILLA), Laurent Romary (ATILF), Joan Spanne (SIL) and Martin Wynne
(OTA).  These people have experiential knowledge of OLAC and will make
decisions about OLAC standards, best practices and repositories as
described in the document process and registration process.

<h2><a name="process"></a>OLAC Process document adopted: [7/03]</h2>

<p>
The OLAC Process document has been promoted to `adopted' status by the
OLAC Advisory Board.  The process document summarizes the governing
ideas of OLAC and describes how OLAC is organized and how it operates,
including the document process and working group process.
First drafted in May 2001, the document has been revised in
consultation with the community over the past two years, as it has
progressed through `draft', `proposed', and `candidate' status.
After one more round of revision in consultation with the Advisory
Board, the document is now adopted as the first OLAC standard.

<h2><a name="1.0"></a>New OLAC infrastructure [5/03]</h2>

<p>
New OLAC infrastructure is now in place, including a
new database schema for the OLAC 1.0 metadata format,
a static repository gateway based on the new OAI standard,
fully updated repository validation and registration software,
and a new open source OLAC software suite released on sourceforge, including
  harvester and aggregator and an OLAC-DC crosswalk.
This infrastructure was developed by
Haejoong Lee, Gary Simons and Steven Bird with sponsorship
from the US National Science Foundation.

<h2><a name="bbc"></a>OLAC in BBC News [3/03]</h2>

<p>
On March 20, 2003, BBC News published an article called <i>Digital
race to save languages</i>, which talks about the language archives
community "fighting against time to save decades of data on the
world's endangered languages from ending on the digital scrap heap."
The article is based on interviews with Steven Bird and Peter Austin.
