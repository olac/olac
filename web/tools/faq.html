    <h3 class="Question"><a name="archive">Is it required that an OLAC
        metadata repository describe an archive?</a></h3>
    <p>In the prototypical case, a participating institution is an
        archive that curates language resources.  In this case, the OLAC metadata
        repository it implements is a catalog of its archival
        holdings. (Participants that operate such archives can be
        identified by the presence of the
        <i>&lt;archivalSubmissionPolicy&gt;</i> element in the 
        <i>&lt;olac-archive&gt;</i> description that is part of the
        Identify response of their repository.)  But operating an archive is not a
        requirement. The mission of OLAC is to create a "worldwide
        virtual library of language resources" and anyone who can
        contribute useful information to the catalog of known language
        resources is invited to do so. This may include contributions
        from individuals rather than institutions.  It may also
        include metadata repositories that are indexes to language resources
        supplied by others or that describe entry points into an online
        database of language-related information.</p>
    
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="record">What do the records in an 
        OLAC metadata repository represent?</a></h3> 
    <p>Each record in an OLAC metadata repository represents a <a
        href="../documents/faq.html#2">language resource</a> that the
        participating archive wants to inform the world about. The
        resource could be a physical object like a book, a CD-ROM, a
        wax cylinder or a box of unpublished field notes. In such
        cases, the metadata record allows potential users to discover
        that the resource exists. When the resource is a digital
        object that is posted on the web (such as a document, a corpus
        of recordings, a database or a software program), then the metadata record can
        go a step further to provide access to the resource by supplying the URL in the
        <i>&lt;dc:identifier&gt;</i> element. The record need not describe
        resource that the contributor actually has under archival
        control. For instance, a record could be an annotated
        bibliography entry in which the contributor has added value to the
        basic citations by supplying a description and subject
        classification. Or a record could describe a web page that is
        an index page giving links to language resources that are
        posted on other web
        sites. </p>
    
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="starting">How do I get started on
        implementing an OLAC metadata repository?</a></h3>
    <p>An OLAC metadata repository is essentially a set of
        language resource descriptions.  A good place to start is to look at the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/NOTE/usage.html">OLAC Metadata Usage Guidelines</a>
        to learn how OLAC describes language resources.  That document
        defines and illustrates each of the possible elements of a
        language resource description. It will be helpful at the same
        time to be looking at <a href="#examples">examples of complete metadata records</a>
        from existing OLAC participants. A key decision you must make
        before you can begin implementing is to 
        <a href="#granularity">decide what to treat as an individual item</a>.
        As you are looking at examples from other OLAC participants,
        make note of records that match your situation and which you
        could use as models for resource description in your repository.
        However, rather than simply using an existing record as a template for
        your own records, you should evaluate it against
        OLAC's <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/bpr.html">
            best practice recommendations for language
            resource description</a>. In the process you may discover ways to improve
        the quality of the metadata records you will produce.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have a good idea of what the records in your repository
        will be like, the next step is to read carefully the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC Repositories</a> 
        standard. You will see that it defines two approaches,
        implementing a
        static repository versus a dynamic repository. You need to
        <a href="#approaches">decide which kind of repository to
        implement</a>, then focus on the corresponding section of
        the OLAC standard. If you are implementing a static repository, you
        will want to look at the more complete
        <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm">Specification for an OAI Static Repository</a>
        which is the standard from the digital library community that
        the OLAC standard is based on.  
        You may also find it helpful at this stage to look at 
        <a href="#eg-static">complete examples of static repositories</a>.
        When you are ready to begin implementing, you may follow the
        instructions for
        <a href="#manual">creating a repository by hand</a> or for
        using a script to <a href="#sample1">generate a repository from a database</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Similarly, if you are
        implementing a dynamic repository, you will need to consult
        the complete specification of the
        <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm">Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</a>
        and may want to see
        <a href="#eg-dynamic">complete examples of dynamic repositories</a>.
        When you are ready to begin implementing, you will want to
        start by searching for <a href="#sample2">sample code</a> that you can use as a
        basis for your implementation.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="granularity">How do I decide what to treat
        as an individual item?</a></h3>
    <p>The <i>OLAC Repositories</i> standard
        addresses this issue in a section on 
        <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html#Guidelines%20concerning%20relevance%20and%20granularity">Guidelines concerning relevance and granularity</a>.
            The basic guideline is this: "A metadata repository
            should treat resources with a single provenance as
            constituting a single unit with respect to OLAC metadata
            and should, therefore, describe them within a single
            record." For published resources, the publication unit
            typically constitutes the appropriate unit for the OLAC
            metadata record. For unpublished papers presenting
            findings of research, these closely parallel typical
            published works, and can be treated at a comparable
            level in an OLAC metadata record. For primary source
            materials (e.g., recordings, transcriptions, annotations,
            notes, data sets), the typical practice of archivists is
            to gather such materials into collections based on shared
            provenance—this is, based on having a common origin and
            history. These collections are then the primary units for
            metadata description, resulting in OLAC records of 
        <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/">DCMI Type</a>
            Collection. See the section on
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/NOTE/usage.html#Granularity%20of%20resources">Granularity of resources</a>
             in the <i>OLAC Metadata Usage Guidelines</i> for a more
            in-depth discussion of the principle of provenance as
            applied to collections and metadata within the OLAC
            context.</p>

    <h3 class="Question"><a name="database">How do I create records
        for a web database?</a></h3>    
    <p>There are many valuable language resources that are underused
        because they are part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web">Deep Web</a>
        (that is, the portion of the Internet that is obscured
        from discovery by general search engines because the
        resources are in a database that is accessible only via a
        search interface on its host site). Such resources can be
        brought to the indexable web by creating OLAC records for
        them, since it is a built-in service of OLAC to convert every
        record into a page that gets crawled by web spiders. (To see
        the set of pages for a given archive, click the <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/archives.php">Archives</a>
        link on the OLAC home page, click the "More Details" link for the
        desired archive, and then click the "Records in Archive" link on the
        resulting Archive Details page.) </p>
    <p>The only requirement on a
        web database for using an OLAC repository to
        expose and access its language resources is that it have
        publicly accessible URLs for the resources. These often
        involve a base URL that uses parameters to provide arguments
        to a query. For instance, the resources in the
        <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/archive/linguistlist.org">LINGUIST
            List Language Resources</a> repository and the
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/archive/odin.csufresno.edu">ODIN: Online Database of Interlinear Text</a>
        repository are dynamic pages that generate a listing of
        everything held in the database about a particular language; the
        ISO 639-3 code for the language is a parameter to the URL that is
        given in the <i>&lt;dc:identifier&gt;</i> element of each record.
        (Click the "Records in Archive" link on the referenced Archive Details
        pages to see sample records.)
    </p>

    <h3 class="Question"><a name="examples">Where can I find good examples of sample metadata records?</a></h3>
    <p>To see the metadata records from 
        a given archive, click the <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/archives.php">Archives</a>
        link on the OLAC home page, click the "More Details" link for the
        desired archive, and then click the "Records in Archive" link on the
        resulting Archive Details page. Alternatively, you may get to
        the same place by going to the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/archive_records/">List Records from an OLAC Archive</a>
        page, selecting an archive from the dropdown list, and then
        clicking the Submit Query button. When you click on the
        identifier for a particular item, you will see an HTML
        representation of the metadata.  To see the underlying XML
        format of the OLAC metadata record, click on the 
        "OAI-PMH request for OLAC format" link.

    <p>The <a
        href="http://www.language-archives.org/tools/survey.php4">Metadata
        Usage Survey</a> tool may be used to see examples of how
        individual metadata elements have been used throughout the
        OLAC catalog. Note, however, that
        many uses do not conform to best practice recommendations. A
        good way to use the tool is to identify ways of using elements
        that do conform to best practice and then click on the link
        for the number of occurrences to see a list of the records in
        which it has been used in this way. It is often helpful to see
        these elements in context to get ideas of how best to
        use them in complete metadata records.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="approaches">How do I decide if I
        should implement a static repository or a dynamic repository?</a></h3>
    <p>There are two basic approaches as laid out in the 
        <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC
            Repositories</a> standard. The first is to build a
        <i>static repository.</i> In a static repository, the entire
        catalog for the repository is expressed in a single XML
        file that contains all of the metadata records.
        That file is registered with the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/sr">OLAC Static Repository Gateway</a>
        which is a live web service that implements the OAI Protocol
        for Metadata Harvesting in order to provide access to the contents of
        all registered repositories.
        This is the simpler of the two approaches and can be used
        when the repository is relatively small&#x2014;the OLAC Static
        Repository Gateway is designed to handle repositories ranging from 1
        to 5,000 records. When there is no existing catalog database, 
        the implementer can use an XML editor to 
        <a href="#manual">create and maintain a repository by hand</a>.
        When there is an existing catalog database, the implementer can
        <a href="#sample1">use a script to export it</a> to the proper XML format.</p>
    <p>The second approach is to implement a
        <i>dynamic repository.</i> This approach can be used for a
        catalog of any size, but when the catalog is 
        larger than 5,000 records, it becomes
        necessary to use this approach. In a dynamic repository,
    the implementer <a href="#sample2">writes program code</a> that
        resides at a base URL on
    a web site and responds to the requests of the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
    in order to provide dynamic access to information in an existing catalog
    database. The trickiest part about implementing a dynamic
    repository is that it is necessary to implement flow control using
    a <a href="#tokens">resumption token</a> mechanism in order to
    ensure that the responses to individual protocol requests are not
    exceedingly large. The OAI community considers half a megabyte 
    to be a reasonable response size (which
    corresponds to about 500 records in a typical repository).</p>
    
    <!-- Static repository -->
    <h2>Implementing a static repository</h2>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="eg-static">Where can I find complete examples of
        static repositories?</a></h3>
    <p>The last thing in the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html#Requirements%20on%20static%20repositories">section on static repositories</a> 
        in the <i>OLAC Repositories</i> standard is a link to a 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.1/static-repository.xml">complete example</a>. 
        Clicking this link retrieves an XML document which is a hypothetical sample repository
        containing two records. 
    </p>
    <p>It is also possible to see the XML document behind each of the
        static repositories that have been implemented by
        participating archives. Approximately nine-tenths of the
        repositories are implemented in this way. A static repository
        can be identified by clicking the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/archives.php4">Archives</a>
        link on the OLAC home page, then clicking the "More Details" link for the
        desired archive. Find the line that says "Base URL" and
        inspect the URL.  If it begins with
        <tt>http://www.language-archives.org/sr/</tt>, then it is a
        static repository. The remainder of the Base URL is the URL
        (minus the <tt>http://</tt>) of the underlying XML document.
        In order to retrieve that document, copy the repository URL
        (by selecting everything in the Base URL following
        <tt>/sr/</tt>) and then paste it into a web browser. </p>
    
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="manual">How would I create and maintain a static repository by hand?</a></h3>
    <p>For a repository that has only a few records, it is very
        straightforward to create it from scratch using an XML editor.
    It also makes sense to build and maintain a larger repository by hand if
    there is no existing database for the metadata. In essence, an XML
    editor can be used to create and maintain a static repository as
    the database. For instructions on how to do this, see the OLAC Informational Note 
    on <i>Using &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor to Create or Validate an OLAC Static 
        Repository</i>. &lt;oXygen/&gt; is a mature and
    full-featured product that offers a 30-day free trial and attractive 
    academic pricing ($48 at the
    time of writing). </p>
    
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="sample1">Where can I find sample code for generating a static repository from a
        database?</a></h3>
    <p>Forthcoming.</p>
    
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="test1">How do I test whether my
        static repository is valid?</a></h3>
    <p>Three possible approaches are described below. Ultimately the
        third approach is the final test that every static repository
        must pass. But before the repository is placed on a publicly
        accessible web site (see <a href="#publish">next question</a>), one of the first two
        methods may be used while the repository is in preparation.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><i>Using a schema validator running on your own
            machine.</i> Forthcoming.</p></li>
        <li><p><i>Using a web-based schema validation service.</i> Forthcoming.</p></li>
        <li><p><i>Using the OLAC validation service.</i> After 
            the static repository file has been placed on a publicly
            accessible web site (see <a href="#publish">next
            question</a>), the final test of conformance to the
            <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC Repositories</a> 
            standard is made by using the 
            <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/register/register.php4">OLAC Archive Registration</a> page.
            Simply paste the URL for the location of your repository
            file into the text box and click the "Validate Only"
            button. If the final line of the report says "SUCCESS,"
            then you are ready to proceed to the <a href="#register">registration step</a>.
            On the other hand, if the final line says "FAILURE," you
            still have work to do. Make note of all the individual
            tests that failed and fix the offending content in the
            repository; then repeat the validation process. In the case of the XML Schema Validation,
            click on the "error logs" link to see the list of errors
            generated by the validator. The two validators report the
            errors differently, so look at both logs to get a fuller idea
            of what is wrong.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Before the job is finished, you will also want to test some of
        your records as described below to discover ways to
        <a href="#quality">improve the quality of the metadata</a> in your
        repository.</p>
    
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="publish">Where do I put my repository when it is ready to publish?</a></h3>
    <p>The XML file for your static repository must be posted on a
        public web site, preferably the site run by your host
        institution. 
        Ideally you will want it where you have write access, since
        you will want to be able to update the repository from time to
        time.  If you do not have access to a public web
        site, contact the OLAC administrators; it is possible
        for a static repository to be hosted on the OLAC site. Once
        your repository is posted for public access, you are in a
        position to <a href="#register">register with OLAC</a>.</p>
    
    <!-- Dynamic repository -->
    <h2>Implementing a dynamic repository</h2>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="eg-dynamic">Where can I find complete examples of
        dynamic repositories?</a></h3>
    <p>Only about one-tenth of the OLAC repositories are implemented
        in this way. Two of them, 
        <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/oai2.asp">Ethnologue</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/sil_archives2.asp">SIL Language and Culture Archives</a>,
        implement a documentation page that provides a large set of
        links for
        testing all the verbs of the harvesting protocol with various
        combinations of parameters, including combinations that should
        generate error responses. You may experience a sample
        implementation and get a better feel for how the protocol
        works by clicking on one of the above links and trying the
        various links on the documentation page.  The text of each
        link gives the complete parameter string that is appended to
        the Base URL to form a full URL. Clicking the link will retrieve
        the XML document which the dynamic repository returns as the response to the request.
        The full request URL will show in the location box of your
        browser. Click the browser's Back button to go back to the
        documentation page and try another protocol request.

    <!-- Registering and updating -->
 <h2>Registering and improving a repository</h2>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="register">How do I register my
        repository with OLAC?</a></h3>
    <p>Once your repository is on a publicly-accessible web site, you
        are in a position to register with OLAC. The first step in the
        registration process is to run the automated validation 
        suite over the repository.
        This is found on the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/register/register.php">OLAC Archive Registration</a>  
        page.  Paste the URL for
            your repository into the text
            box and click the "Validate" button.  This performs
            tests for the conditions described in the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC
        Repositories</a> standard and for XML schema validation.
            If the final line of the report says "FAILURE,"
            then you still have work to do. Make note of all the
            individual tests that failed and fix the offending
            content in the repository; then repeat the
            validation process. If the XML Schema
            Validation is failing, click on the "error logs" link to see
            the list of errors generated by the XML parsers. The
            two parsers report the errors differently, so
            look at both logs to get a fuller idea of what is
            wrong.</p>
    <p>When the
        final line of the validation report says "SUCCESS," then 
        you will be presented with a button that allows you to
        submit a registration request. After clicking the button, you should get an
        email confirmation of the submission.  The OLAC Coordinators
        also receive notification of the pending registration request. 
        They review the repository to ensure that it meets the
        criteria enumerated in the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/process.html#The%20registration%20process">OLAC Process</a>
        standard, namely, that it must catalog language resources and
        must conform to the standards of OLAC.
        Following this review you will receive an email notification
        describing the outcome, either confirmation that the repository has been
        accepted and harvested, or an explanation concerning what is
        not yet in order.</p>
        
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="quality">How do I improve the quality of the metadata
        in my repository?</a></h3>
    <p>OLAC has defined <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/bpr.html">best practice recommendations for language
    resource description</a>. You should review a few records from
        your repository against this list of recommendations to see if
        there are things you could change in the implementation of
        your repository (or of the underlying database on which it is
        based) to follow even more of the recommendations. It is not
        possible to automate tests for compliance to all the
        recommendations, so a complete review must be done by hand.
        If you would like help doing such an audit of metadata
        quality, contact the OLAC Coordinators; the link in the
        footer of this page is a <tt>mailto:</tt> link to their addresses. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, many aspects of metadata quality can be automatically
        tested. OLAC has implemented 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/NOTE/metrics.html">metadata metrics</a> to
        give implementers feedback on how well they have followed those
        recommendations. The 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/tools/metadata/freestanding.html">Freestanding Metadata Service</a> allows you
        to learn the metadata quality score for any record. Simply
        paste the complete <i>&lt;olac:olac></i> record into the text
        box on the page and click the "Analyze" button. If the format
        of the record is not valid, the resulting page will report the
        errors.  Otherwise, the resulting page shows an analysis of
        the record. The bottom part of the page gives
        the metadata quality score  
        along with recommendations on changes that would improve 
        the  score. It is possible to click the browser's Back
        button to return to the record entry form, edit the record
        to make changes that you think will improve the quality score,
        and then click "Analyze" again to test the result.</p>
