<H3> <A NAME="1"></A>1. What is the Open Language Archives Community?</H3>
<P> The <A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/"> Open Language Archives
Community</A>, or OLAC, is an international partnership of institutions and
individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources
by: (i) developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving
of language resources, and (ii) developing a network of interoperating
repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources. See the
<A HREF="../documents/faq.html"> general FAQ</A> for answers to questions about
OLAC in general. </P>
<H3> <A NAME="2"></A>2. What is a language resource?</H3>
<P> A language resource is any kind of DATA, TOOL or ADVICE pertaining to the
documentation, description or analysis of a human language. Texts, recordings,
dictionaries, annotations, field notebooks, software, protocols, data models,
file formats, newsgroup archives and web indexes are some examples of such
resources. OLAC metadata can be used to describe any kind of language resource.
Language resources may be digital or non-digital, published or restricted. A
language archive is any collection of language resources and their resource
descriptions. </P>
<H3> <A NAME="3"></A>3. What is language resource discovery?</H3>
<P> The most familiar methods for language resource discovery are mailing
lists, web indexes, and the catalogs of archives and publishers. Users of these
methods typically experience low precision and recall&Acirc;&#151;one has to
wade through many irrelevant resources, and relevant resources are easily
overlooked. OLAC seeks to improve that situation by developing an
infrasturcture for language resource discovery. A key part of that
infrastructure is a metadata set that is specialized for language resource
description. </P>
<H3> <A NAME="4"></A>4. What is metadata?</H3>
<P> The simplest definition of metadata is &quot;structured data about
data.&quot; Metadata is descriptive information about an object or resource
whether it be physical or electronic. While the term metadata itself is
relatively new, the underlying concepts behind metadata have been in use for as
long as collections of information have been organized. Library card catalogs
represent a well-established type of metadata; they have served as collection
management and resource discovery tools for decades. Metadata can be generated
either &quot;by hand&quot; or gnerated automatically using software. </P>
<H3> <A NAME="5"></A>5. What is the OLAC Metadata Set?</H3>
<P> The OLAC Metadata Set (OLACMS) is the set of metadata elements that members
of OLAC have agreed to use for describing language resources. Uniform
description across archives is ensured by limiting the values of certain
metadata elements to the use of terms from agreed-upon
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0105030">controlled vocabularies</A>. The
OLACMS is equally applicable whether the resources are available online or not.
The metadata set consists of all the elements of the
<A HREF="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">Dublin Core Metadata Set</A>, a
widely accepted standard for describing resources of all types. To this core
set, OLACMS adds a set of refinements and qualifications that are designed for
describing fundamental properties of <I>language</I> resources, such as subject
language, language data type, and software functionality. The
<A HREF="/OLAC/olacms.html">OLACMS Standard</A> uses XML to represent metadata
descriptions. </P>
<H3> <A NAME="6"></A>6. How is OLAC metadata disseminated?</H3>
<P> OLAC metadata is disseminated using the
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm"> metadata
harvesting protocol</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/"> Open
Archives Initiative</A> (OAI). End users can access the metadata using an
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/service_provider/oai_sp.htm"> OAI service
provider</A> (which indexes both OLAC and non-OLAC archives based on Dublin
Core metadata) or an <A HREF="/search.html">OLAC service provider</A> (which
provides services unique to language resources by using the
language-resource-specific metadata in the OLAC Metadata Set). </P>
<H3> <A NAME="7"></A>7. Who can benefit from using OLAC metadata?</H3>
<P> Anyone can use the OLAC Metadata Set to describe language resources.
Language archives and language software repositories are the most common
providers of OLAC metadata. (Participating archives and prospective
participants are listed on the <A HREF="/organization.html">OLAC
Organization</A> page.) Individual researchers will soon be able to document
the resources they manage using a simple form interface. The whole language
resources community will be empowered by OLAC metadata, being able to quickly
identify relevant resources. </P>
<H3> <A NAME="8"></A>8. What is meant by <I>Open</I> in the context of Open
Language Archives? </H3>
<P> OLAC is <I>open</I> in the sense that any archive can join, and any
individual can access the metadata records of participating archives.
Membership and access are free. Also, the process by which OLAC governs itself
and makes decisions is visible to all community members and open to their
participation. <I>Open</I> does not mean that users are free to do whatever
they like with the metadata, nor does it mean that the described language
resources are openly available. </P>
<H3> <A NAME="9"></A>9. How does a language archive join OLAC?</H3>
<P> OLAC is open to participation by any language archive. To participate,
archives must set up an OAI &quot;data provider'', exporting their catalogs to
the Dublin Core and OLAC metadata formats for harvesting by the OAI Metadata
Harvesting Protocol, and then register with the OAI and OLAC. In general, the
catalog remains in its existing format (e.g. in a relational database) and a
CGI script permits external services to harvest the records in the prescribed
XML format. A second approach avoids the OAI protocol altogether. An entire
metadata repository is dumped in a single XML file, and the OLAC virtual data
provider takes care of the rest. For more information about both options,
please see the page: <A HREF="implement.html">How to Become an OLAC Data
Provider</A>. </P>
<H3> <A NAME="10"></A>10. Can an individual or small archive join OLAC without
bothering with formats and protocols?</H3>
<P> A simple form interface has been developed which permits individuals and
small archives to document their resources. The only requirements for this
method is a web browser. For more information please see the ORE page at
<A HREF="http://www.linguistlist.org/ore">http://www.linguistlist.org/ore</A>.
In addition, any individual interested in language resource development and
archiving can join the community by self-subscribing to the
<A HREF="http://lists.linguistlist.org/archives/olac-general.html">OLAC-General
mailing list</A>. This is the means by which members of the community are
informed of new developments and invited to participate in reviews and working
groups.</P>
<H3> <A NAME="11"></A>11. How are language standards like the TEI represented
in OLAC?</H3>
<P> In OLAC parlance, <I>standards</I> refer to procedures and formats that
govern participating services, such as the OLAC Metadata Set or the OAI
Metadata Harvesting Protocol. In OLAC, so-called &quot;language standards''
like the TEI are viewed as a kind of language resource called ADVICE since they
are not binding on members. OLAC follows a <A
HREF="/OLAC/process.html">process</A> involving working groups and voting,
whereby such advice can become identified as community-agreed best practice. 
</P>
<H3> <A NAME="12"></A>12. How do I contribute new proposals for OLAC metadata? 
</H3>
<P> Please join the <A HREF="/wg/metadata/">OLAC Metadata working group</A> and
post your proposal to the working group's mailing list. </P>
