    <h3 class="Question"><a name="archive">Is it required that a
        metadata repository describe an archive?</a></h3>
    <p>In the prototypical case, a participating institution is an
        archive that curates language resources.  In this case, the OLAC metadata
        repository it implements is a catalog of its archival
        holdings. (Participants that operate such archives can be
        identified by the presence of the
        <i>&lt;archivalSubmissionPolicy&gt;</i> element in the 
        <i>&lt;olac-archive&gt;</i> description that is part of the
        Identify response of their repository.)  But operating an archive is not a
        requirement. The mission of OLAC is to create a "worldwide
        virtual library of language resources" and anyone who can
        contribute useful information to the catalog of known language
        resources is invited to do so. This may include contributions
        from individuals rather than institutions.  It may also
        include metadata repositories that are indexes to language resources
        supplied by others or that describe entry points into an online
        database of language-related information.</p>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="record">What do the records in an OLAC
        metadata repository represent?</a></h3> 
    <p>Each record in an OLAC metadata repository represents a <a
        href="../documents/faq.html#2">language resource</a> that the
        participating archive wants to inform the world about. The
        resource could be a physical object like a book, a CD-ROM, a
        wax cylinder or a box of unpublished field notes. In such
        cases, the metadata record allows potential users to discover
        that the resource exists. When the resource is a digital
        object that is posted on the web (such as a document, a corpus
        of recordings, a database or a software program), then the metadata record can
        go a step further to provide access to the resource by supplying the URL in the
        <i>&lt;dc:identifier&gt;</i> element. The record need not describe
        resource that the contributor actually has under archival
        control. For instance, a record could be an annotated
        bibliography entry in which the contributor has added value to the
        basic citations by supplying a description and subject
        classification. Or a record could describe a web page that is
        an index page giving links to language resources that are
        posted on other web
        sites. </p>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="granularity">How do I decide what to treat
        as an individual item?</a></h3>
    <p>The <i>OLAC Repositories</i> standard
        addresses this issue in a section on 
        <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html#Guidelines%20concerning%20relevance%20and%20granularity">Guidelines concerning relevance and granularity</a>.
            The basic guideline is this: "A metadata repository
            should treat resources with a single provenance as
            constituting a single unit with respect to OLAC metadata
            and should, therefore, describe them within a single
            record." For published resources, the publication unit
            typically constitutes the appropriate unit for the OLAC
            metadata record. For unpublished papers presenting
            findings of research, these closely parallel typical
            published works, and can be treated at a comparable
            level in an OLAC metadata record. For primary source
            materials (e.g., recordings, transcriptions, annotations,
            notes, data sets), the typical practice of archivists is
            to gather such materials into collections based on shared
            provenanceâ€”this is, based on having a common origin and
            history. These collections are then the primary units for
            metadata description, resulting in OLAC records of 
        <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/">DCMI Type</a>
            Collection. See the section on
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/NOTE/usage.html#Granularity%20of%20resources">Granularity of resources</a>
             in the <i>OLAC Metadata Usage Guidelines</i> for a more
            in-depth discussion of the principle of provenance as
            applied to collections and metadata within the OLAC
            context.</p>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="database">How do I create records
        for a web database?</a></h3>    
    <p>There are many valuable language resources that are underused
        because they are part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web">Deep Web</a>
        (that is, the portion of the Internet that is obscured
        from discovery by general search engines because the
        resources are in a database that is accessible only via a
        search interface on its host site). Such resources can be
        brought to the indexable web by creating OLAC records for
        them, since it is a built-in service of OLAC to convert every
        record into a page that gets crawled by web spiders. (To see
        the set of pages for a given archive, click the <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/archives.php">Archives</a>
        link on the OLAC home page, click the "More Details" link for the
        desired archive, and then click the "Records in Archive" link on the
        resulting Archive Details page.) </p>
    <p>The only requirement on a
        web database for using an OLAC repository to
        expose and access its language resources is that it have
        publicly accessible URLs for the resources. These often
        involve a base URL that uses parameters to provide arguments
        to a query. For instance, the resources in the
        <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/archive/linguistlist.org">LINGUIST
            List Language Resources</a> repository and the
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/archive/odin.csufresno.edu">ODIN: Online Database of Interlinear Text</a>
        repository are dynamic pages that generate a listing of
        everything held in the database about a particular language; the
        ISO 639-3 code for the language is a parameter to the URL that is
        given in the <i>&lt;dc:identifier&gt;</i> element of each record.
        (Click the "Records in Archive" link on the referenced Archive Details
        pages to see sample records.)
    </p>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="examples">Where can I find good examples of sample metadata records?</a></h3>
    <p>To see the metadata records from 
        a given archive, click the <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/archives.php">Archives</a>
        link on the OLAC home page, click the "More Details" link for the
        desired archive, and then click the "Records in Archive" link on the
        resulting Archive Details page. Alternatively, you may get to
        the same place by going to the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/archive_records/">List Records from an OLAC Archive</a>
        page, selecting an archive from the dropdown list, and then
        clicking the Submit Query button. When you click on the
        identifier for a particular item, you will see an HTML
        representation of the metadata.  To see the underlying XML
        format of the OLAC metadata record, click on the 
        "OAI-PMH request for OLAC format" link.

    </ul>
    <p>The <a
        href="http://www.language-archives.org/tools/survey.php4">Metadata
        Usage Survey</a> tool may be used to see examples of how
        individual metadata elements have been used throughout the
        OLAC catalog. Note, however, that
        many uses do not conform to best practice recommendations. A
        good way to use the tool is to identify ways of using elements
        that do conform to best practice and then click on the link
        for the number of occurrences to see a list of the records in
        which it has been used in this way. It is often helpful to see
        these elements in context to get ideas of how best to
        use them in complete metadata records.
    </p>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="approaches">What are the possible approaches to implementing an OLAC metadata
        repository?</a></h3>
    <p>There are two basic approaches as laid out in the 
        <a
            href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC
            Repositories</a> standard. The first is to build a
        <i>static repository.</i> In a static repository, the entire
        catalog for the repository is expressed in a single XML
        file that contains all of the metadata records.
        That file is registered with the 
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/sr">OLAC Static Repository Gateway</a>
        which is a live web service that implements the OAI Protocol
        for Metadata Harvesting in order to provide access to the contents of
        all registered repositories.
        This is the simpler of the two approaches and should be used
        when the repository is relatively small (<i>e.g.,</i> up to a thousand
        records). When there is no existing catalog database, 
        the implementer can use an XML editor to 
        <a href="#manual">create a repository by hand</a>.
        When there is an existing catalog database, the provider can
        <a href="#sample1">use a script to export it</a> to the proper XML format.</p>
    <p>The second approach is to build a
        <i>dynamic repository.</i> When the catalog is relatively
        large (<i>e.g.,</i> over a thousand records), it becomes
        necessary to implement a dynamic repository. In this approach,
    the implementer <a href="#sample2">writes program code</a> that
        resides at a base URL on
    a web site and implements the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
    to provide access to information in an existing catalog
    database. The size limit for a static repository has to do with
    the size of responses in the OAI protocol; the optimal size for a
    response is about 500 kilobytes.  When the entire catalog
    in XML format exceeds one megabyte in size, then a dynamic
    repository is needed in order to break large responses into
    mulitple packets using the <a href="#tokens">resumption token</a> mechanism.</p>
    
    <!-- Static repository -->
    <h2>Implementing a static repository</h2>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="sample1">Where can I find sample code for generating a static repository from a
        database?</a></h3>
    <p>Forthcoming.</p>

    <p>Forthcoming.</p>
    <h3 class="Question"><a name="test1">How do I test whether my
        static repository is valid?</a></h3>
    <p>Three possible approaches are described below. Ultimately the
        third approach is the final test that every static repository
        must pass. But before the repository is placed on a publicly
        accessible web site (see <a href="#publish">next question</a>), one of the first two
        methods may be used while the repository is in preparation.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><i>Using a schema validator running on your own machine.</i></p></li>
        <li><p><i>Using a web-based schema validation service.</i></p></li>
        <li><p><i>Using the OLAC validation service.</i> After 
            the static repository file has been placed on a publicly
            accessible web site (see <a href="#publish">next
            question</a>), the final test of conformance to the
            <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC Repositories</a> 
            standard is made by using the 
            <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/register/register.php4">OLAC Archive Registration</a> page.
            Simply paste the URL for the location of your repository
            file into the text box and click the "Validate Only"
            button. If the final line of the report says "SUCCESS,"
            then you are ready to proceed to the <a href="#register">registration step</a>.
            On the other hand, if the final line says "FAILURE," you
            still have work to do. Make note of all the individual
            tests that failed and fix the offending content in the
            repository; then repeat the validation process. In the case of the XML Schema Validation,
            click on the "error logs" link to see the list of errors
            generated by the validator. The two validators report the
            errors differently, so look at both logs to get a fuller idea
            of what is wrong.</p>
