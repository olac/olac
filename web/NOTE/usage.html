         <h2><A name="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction
         </h2>
         <p>This document provides guidelines on how to describe language resources using the OLAC metadata standard
            					[<a href="#OLAC-Metadata">OLAC-Metadata</a>]. The standard itself documents the formal syntax of valid metadata records,
            				but does not explain or exemplify the use of the individual metadata elements. That is the purpose of
            				this document. 
         </p>
         <p>Section 2 below describes the usage of the attributes that may be used on metadata elements. Section 3
            				then describes usage in the OLAC context for the fifteen core elements of the Dublin Core metadata set.
            				Section 4 describes other elements that may be used..
         </p>
         <h2><A name="All elements"></A>2. All elements
         </h2>
         <p>Four attributes&#8212;<i>refine, code, scheme,</i> and <i>lang</i>&#8212;are used throughout the
            				XML implementation of the metadata elements. A fifth attribute, <i>langs,</i> is used on complete
            				metadata records. These are described in turn below.
         </p>
         <p> Some elements in the OLAC metadata set use the <i>refine</i> attribute to identify element refinements.
            				These qualifiers make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the
            				meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope [<a href="#DC-Q">DC-Q</a>]. When an element
            				does use a <i>refine</i> attribute, the possible values for the attribute are restricted to a specified
            				controlled vocabulary.
         </p>
         <p>Some elements in the OLAC metadata set use the <i>code</i> attribute to hold metadata values that are
            				taken from a specific encoding scheme. The attribute value is always a precise value taken from a
            				controlled vocabulary or a formal notation that is described in another OLAC document. As a result, all
            				service providers are able to interpret uniformly the meaning of any <i>code</i> value. The terms of a
            				controlled vocabulary are also incorporated into the XML schema for OLAC metadata; thus every
            				<i>code</i> value is tested for validity when the OLAC registration server tests a data provider for
            				conformance to OLAC standards [<a href="#OLAC-Registration">OLAC-Registration</a>]. For elements that have a <i>code</i>
            				attribute, the element content may also be used to specify a freeform elaboration of the coded value.
         </p>
         <p>Every element in the OLAC metadata set may use the <i>scheme</i> attribute. It specifies a standardized
            				name for the scheme that constrains how the text in the content of the element is encoded. A scheme may
            				be a controlled vocabulary or a formal notation. Recommended best practice is to confine the value of
            					<i>scheme</i> to the label for one of the encoding schemes registered with the Dublin Core Metadata
            				Initiative [<a href="#DCMI-Registry">DCMI-Registry</a>]. Members of the OLAC community who want to use an unregistered
            				scheme should submit it for registration [<a href="#DCMI-Submit">DCMI-Submit</a>]. When OLAC data providers are tested for
            				conformance to OLAC recommended best practice, only the value of the <i>scheme</i> attribute is tested
            				for inclusion in the list of registered schemes. OLAC does not test the actual element content for
            				conformance to the scheme; a service provider for a subcommunity that has developed a particular scheme
            				could perform such a test. 
         </p>
         <p>Every element in the OLAC metadata set may use the <i>lang</i> attribute. It specifies the language in
            				which the text in the content of the element is written. The value for the attribute comes from the
            				controlled vocabulary defined by [<a href="#OLAC-Language">OLAC-Language</a>]. By default, the <i>lang</i> attribute has the
            				value "en", for English. Whenever the language of the element content is other than English, recommended
            				best practice is to use the <i>lang</i> attribute to identify the language. By using multiple instances
            				of the metadata elements tagged for different languages, data providers may offer their metadata records
            				in multiple languages. 
         </p>
         <p>The <i>langs</i> attribute is used on the <tt>&lt;olac&gt;</tt> element&#8212;the container
            				for all the metadata elements of a given metadata record. It lists the languages in which the metadata
            				record is designed to be read. This attribute holds a space-delimited list of language codes from the
            					[<a href="#OLAC-Language">OLAC-Language</a>] controlled vocabulary. By default, this attribute has the value "en", for
            				English, indicating that the record is aimed only at English readers. If an explicit value is given for
            				the attribute, then the record is aimed at readers of all the languages listed.
         </p>
         <p>Service providers should use this information in order to offer localized views of the metadata. When a
            				metadata record lists only one language, then all elements should be displayed (regardless of their
            				individual languages), unless the user has requested to suppress all records in that language. When a
            				metadata record has multiple alternative languages, the user should be able to select one and have
            				display of elements in the other languages suppressed. An element in a language not included in the list
            				of alternatives should always be displayed (for instance, the vernacular title of a work).
         </p>
         <p>In a given metadata record, every element is optional and every element except the
            					<tt>&lt;title&gt;</tt> element is repeatable.

               <td>
                  <p>Minimal best practice is for the value of each metadata element to conform to the definition of
                     						that element.
                  </p>
                  <p>When the meaning of a particular element in a metadata record fits the definition of a
                     						refinement, recommended best practice is to use the refinement rather than the generic element.
                  </p>
                  <p>Whenever the language of the element content is other than English, recommended best practice is
                     						to use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute with a value from [<a href="#ISO639-3">ISO639-3</a>] to identify the
                     						language.
                  </p>
                  <p>When a resource has more than one value for a particular metadata element, recommended best
                     						practice is to use a separate instance of the metadata element for each instance rather than
                     						listing all the values in a single instance.

         </h2>
         <p>Each of the core elements of the Dublin Core metadata set is described in one of the following
            				subsections. The heading gives the name of the element; the element is then described under six
            				subheadings. <i>Definition</i> is the definition for the element as given by the Dublin Core Metadata
            				Initiative [<a href="#DCMT">DCMT</a>]. <i>Refinements</i> lists the refined element names (from the <i>dcterms</i>
            				namespace) that may be used in place of the generic element name to specify a more precise meaning for
            				the metadata item. The refinement definitions are copied from [<a href="#DCMT">DCMT</a>]. <i>Schemes</i> lists the
            				encoding schemes that may be used with this element (or its refinements) as the value of the
            				<i>xsi:type</i> attribute. <i>Best practices</i> lists the best practices for the use of this element
            				that are recommended by the OLAC community [<a href="#OLAC-BP">OLAC-BP</a>]. <i>Usage notes</i> offers additional
            				notes for the OLAC community on how to use the element in the context of describing language resources.
            					<i>Examples</i> shows samples of properly encoded elements and sample refinements.
         </p>
         <p>For many elements, you can have more than one instance. This would be the case for a work with more than
            				one author, or for which you want to specify two or three languages, multiple subject terms, etc. In
            				such cases, repeat the element for each person, language, etc., rather than placing all of them in a
            				single instance of the field. Most elements can be repeated if needed.

                     						in surname first, in inverted order (for western and other names generally written with the
                     						family name last). For the names of organizations, this means that any initial article should be

                  <p>Recommended best practice is to use the <i>olac:role</i> scheme to indicate the role of the

                  <p>Minimal best practice is that a metadata record should contain at least one Description or

                  </p>
                  <p>For computer files, great levels of detail in the file organization and complex coded naming
                     						schemes for file names are generally less satisfactory than explicit descriptions of the files
                     						included on a given media unit. Coded file naming schemes are difficult to apply accurately and
                     						can lead to mistakes in description and potentially to loss of materials actually in the
                     						collection, because they cannot be identified. For this reason, it is best to explicitly
                     						describe files (and dependently related sets of files) in a document such as a Table Of Contents
                     						file.

                  <p>Description may include but is not limited to: an abstract, table of contents, reference to a

                  </p>
                  <p>No formatting conventions are defined within the text of Description. Service providers may
                     						format the entire Description as a single paragraph, collapsing adjacent white space characters
                     						into a single space.
                  </p>
                  <p>When there is a URL for a document that describes the resource, use a separate Description
                     						element to encode just that URL. A Description that begins with "http:" will be interpreted by
                     						service providers as consisting solely of a URL and will be presented as a link in user
                     						interfaces. Service providers are not obliged to search other Description text for the
                     						occurrence of URLs.
                  </p>
                  <p>Description may include but is not limited to: an abstract, table of contents, reference to a
                     						graphical representation of content or a free-text account of the content. For the original SIL
                     						TOC, use this element to map \anno annotation &lt;annotation&gt;, a qualitative or
                     						evaluative comment about this resource, including judgment about suitability for a particular
                     						application or context.
                  </p>
                  <p>If the description is either an abstract or a table of contents for the resource, that may be
                     						specified in this element. If the description is other than one of these, leave \descType empty.
                  </p>
                  <p>Clarity and consistency in naming are the most important; there is a specific place in the
                     						description that can be used to give additional identifying information.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Item level metadata entry carries the information about each specific work. The work can be a
                     						stapled paper document, a sound recording on tape, a computer file or several computer files
                     						that together constitute a single document. One entry can even contain information about a
                     						sub-collection of like items, given that certain qualifications are met. Some types of materials
                     						naturally assemble into a sub-collection, such as a group of recordings, texts or photographs in
                     						a single language or relating to a single community, etc. Such a collection can be documented in
                     						a single metadata entry, provided that: &#8226; All the materials are of the same access level,
                     						medium, and type. &#8226; They are documented in more detail in a separate file included with the
                     						collection, which describes each individual piece in terms appropriate to the matieral&#8212;see
                     						section 2.4.4. &#8226; If submitted on computer media, all materials are grouped into a single parent
                     						directory (which may contain subdirectories, as needed).
                  </p>
                  <p>Documenting a body of materials as a collection, as is typical with a group of recordings or
                     						language texts, can be done with simplified documentation in the main TOC file and a
                     						supplementary documentation file with details for each text or recording. It should be a text
                     						file, preferably tab delimited or tagged, to facilitate loading into a database. Such a file
                     						ought to include as much as is known for each text, photograph or recording: &#8226; Label used with
                     						original (on tape, box, photo or text), if it uniquely identifies the item within the collection
                     						&#8226; Date of work, in yyyymmdd or the appropriate level of precision &#8226; Title, if there is a
                     						meaningful title given by the creator &#8226; Title gloss, if useful &#8226; Event or context of recording
                     						or photograph &#8226; Keyword description of the genre (e.g., procedure, folk tale, description of
                     						event, etc.) or subject &#8226; Length in hh:mm:ss (for recording) or in word count (for a text) &#8226; For
                     						recordings or texts o Speaker or writer&#8217;s name, if this is a work of original creation by the
                     						speaker (a story teller, an original song, etc.) and thus appropriate to credit the creator
                     						(otherwise, maintain the person&#8217;s privacy) o Speaker age (approximate) o Speaker gender o
                     						Speaker status or role in community which might be relevant in analyzing a text &#8226; For
                     						photographs o Photographer&#8217;s name o Identifiable subjects&#8217; names (unless this would constitute a
                     						violation of privacy as considered in light of the community&#8217;s or person&#8217;s known preferences),
                     						ages, roles in community
                  </p>
                  <p>Some types of materials naturally &#8220;go together&#8221; because they share a lot of identical aspects of
                     						their descriptions, for example, a group of texts in recorded or written form narrated or
                     						written by the same language informant, or a set of photographs of a single community or event.
                     						Think of these groups of related resources as sub-collections. Organizing materials into
                     						sub-collections helps a great deal in the descriptive task, because each sub-collection can be
                     						documented in a single OLAC metadata entry. Doing this does not mean that the individual items
                     						get no individual descriptions. It means that the individual descriptions can be much shorter,
                     						more specific, and tailored to the characteristics of the materials. The descriptions of the
                     						individual works should be uniform within the sub-collection, but they don&#8217;t have to be
                     						OLAC-conformant. Only the single &#8220;parent&#8221; record must be OLAC. The criteria for creating
                     						sub-collection descriptions are: &#8226; The sub-collection has a single OLAC record, in which the
                     						\type element is repeated and the second instance contains &#8220;Collection&#8221;. The first instance of
                     						\type will reflect the actual type of all the resources: text, still image, or sound, for
                     						example. The name of the collection as a whole is given in this record, as are all the metadata
                     						contents common to every item in the collection. &#8226; All the materials are of the same access
                     						level and are from the same language program. Any other metadata that is common to every item in
                     						the collection can also be documented in the OLAC collection record and need not be repeated in
                     						the item record. Such things as medium and creator may or may not be the same, but even if they
                     						are, it is best to document them in the individual record for the particular text (next point).
                     						&#8226; Each item in the sub-collection is documented in a record in a sub-collection description
                     						file, which has a set of elements relevant specifically to texts, or to photos, or to whatever
                     						kind of thing makes up the sub-collection. These need not be OLAC metadata elements, but if a
                     						needed element corresponds to the meaning and usage of a specific OLAC element, use the OLAC
                     						element rather than giving it a different label. &#8226; If submitted on computer media, all materials
                     						are grouped into a single parent directory (which may contain subdirectories, as needed) Whereas
                     						the OLAC metadata record is based on an external standard, the file used to describe a
                     						collection can be more flexible, with adjustments particular to the collection itself. Elements
                     						used are typically text name, creator(s) and some demographic data about them, other significant
                     						participants , date, location, event or setting (&#8220;occasion&#8221;), literary or musical genre, topic,
                     						or any other appropriate specialized information. For texts (including sound recording
                     						versions), it is recommended that this be done in a supplementary Toolbox file using the
                     						textcat.typ database type definition (the Text_Collection.db is an empty database of this type),
                     						which can be kept in the same Toolbox project. Another method may be used, such as a
                     						spreadsheet, though keeping track of multiple versions of the same text gets more complicated in
                     						a single table or spreadsheet. This sub-collection description file is to be included with the
                     						main OLAC metadata file when materials are deposited with an archives. You may wish to create a
                     						new database type, possibly based on textcat.typ, for a collection of another kind of resource
                     						such as photographs. Where a data elements would be used the same way as an OLAC element, it is
                     						best to simply use the same OLAC element (which the textcat.typ does), with the same definitions
                     						and appropriate range sets. More ideas about documenting collections can be found in the
                     						following article from Notes on Linguistics: Spanne, Joan. 2001. "The linguist&#8217;s role in
                     						archiving linguistic data resources." Notes on Linguistics 4(1): 4-15.
                  </p>
                  <p> The Description element should not be confused with
                     						Subject. Description contains free-text descriptions, while Subject contains subject headings.
                  </p>
                  <p>Description element is not a "catch-all" category. Consider using Format element for extent or

                           <p>Published materials which are produced in paper or other non-computer media should be
                              								archived in that medium.... However, data sets and language texts (including Scripture
                              								portions) are resource types that are almost always sought in source form for use in
                              								further linguistic analysis or for later revision, no matter the age of the data or
                              								text. For such materials, the need is for long term preservation of a computer based
                              								source form. A non-proprietary, standardized format, such as SFM or XML, is most
                              								desirable.

                  <p>The element content may be left empty, but it would typically be used to add further details
                     						about the format of the resource, such as the sampling rate for digital recordings, the size of
                     						computer files, the number of pages and dimensions of a book, the appearance of a physical
                     						object, and so on. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The procedures, media and formats for unpublished materials are very much dependent upon the
                     						nature of materials and the anticipated uses, both short- and long-term. Table 1 gives
                     						suggestions for what should be submitted by users, but it only addresses common types of
                     						materials. If possible, both a source and a presentation form of the work should be submitted. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The FORMAT of a computer file refers to the encoding scheme used to represent the data (in 1&#8217;s
                     						and 0&#8217;s), and relates to the software and/or hardware required to access and use the object.
                     						Usually represented by the suffix of a computer file name, e.g., WAV or MP3 for sound recording
                     						objects, TIFF, JPEG, GIF, BMP for images, MPEG for full-motion image streams, DOC for a Word
                     						document, XML for an eXtensible Markup Language document, SFM for a Standard Format Marked data
                     						file.
                  </p>
                  <p>Web content of a more document-like nature (a specific title, a credited author, and a date),
                     						such as an electronic working paper series, should be archived, and can usually be handled
                     						similarly to a print publication. Articles written by SIL authors for electronic journals or
                     						other formal web publications on other web sites should also be archived. Materials initially
                     						published in print (or on audio cassette, etc.) and converted for the web should be elsewhere
                     						included in the archives collection, though the new computer form (PDF, HTML, MP3) might also be
                     						suitable for maintaining as a presentation form.
                  </p>
                  <p>Format, which includes the names of media types such as
                     						photograph, should not be confused with Type, which categorizes the nature or genre of the
                     						content of the resource and includes terms that describe general categories, functions, genres,
                     						or aggregation levels for content.

                     						to locate a resource within the collection.
                  </p>
                  <p>Identifiers that begin with "http:" will be interpreted by service providers as URLs and be
                     						presented as links in user interfaces. Note that Identifier is to be used only for a URL that
                     						retrieves the actual resource; use <a href="#Description">Description</a> for a URL that retrieves just a
                     						description of the resource.
                  </p>
                  <p>Do not specify the "oai:" identifier for the resource itself as a value of Identifier, since it
                     						is already given in <tt>&lt;identifier&gt;</tt> in the <tt>&lt;header&gt;</tt>
                     						of the <tt>&lt;record&gt;</tt>s returned by the OAI protocol.

                  <p>The expectation is that all the materials originating from a specific language program will
                     						constitute one collection. Where two (or more) separate programs have operated in a single

                     						Collection Identifier can also include some distinguishing information, such as dialect. For
                     						example, a project in the Leemo dialect of the Hadiyya language of Ethiopia would construct a
                     						primary identifier as: ETG-hdy_Leemo-001.
                  </p>
                  <p>Alternatively, it might be desirable to gather materials from a single program that serves
                     						multiple languages into a single set of records. To indicate a cluster language program, use the
                     						same name (or a code) used within the entity to identify the program. The language of any one
                     						resource is specified within its particular metadata record. Codes of three letters for other
                     						than ISO language codes should be avoided in the Specific Collection Identifier segment (but
                     						other code schemas may be okay).
                  </p>
                  <p>For materials that originate from other than language program work, a different identification is
                     						needed. This could be an author&#8217;s surname for the collection of works by one scholar. It could
                     						also be a department name for materials pertaining to a specific department, e.g., SurveyDept.

                  <p>&#8211; Many non-unique Identifier URLs: &#8226; In a few archives, multiple resources were &#8216;identified&#8217; with
                     						the same URL, usually availability info or a further description, but not the resource itself &#8226;
                     						Often apparently mistaken as the only place one could put a URL associated with this resource &#8226;
                     						Sometimes incomplete (relative?) paths given &#8211; Some identifiers seemed useful only to the
                     						archives, but were not relevant for resource discovery or request for access

                  <p>Language is used for a language the resource is in, as opposed to the language it describes (see
                     							<a href="#Subject.language">Subject.language</a>). It is related to the audience for the work in that it
                     						identifies a language that the creator of the resource assumes that its eventual user will
                     						understand. When a resource is in more than one language, use a separate Language element for
                     						each language.
                  </p>
                  <p>For a work of literature or other monolingual document aimed at the speakers of a particular
                     						language, use Language to identify that language. For a sound recording, use Language for the
                     						language being spoken in the recording. For a grammatical description, for instance, use
                     						Language for the language the grammar is written in; use Subject.language for the language whose
                     						grammar is being described. For an annotated text, use Language for the language in which the
                     						annotations are made; use Subject.language for the language of the base text that is being
                     						annotated. For a dictionary, use Language for the language in which the definitions are written;
                     						use Subject.language for the language whose words are being defined.
                  </p>
                  <p>For scholarly works, this will usually be a major language (English, French, Indonesian, etc.).
                     						For vernacular works, it will be the minority language and will usually be the same as the
                     						language coded in subject_language. Repeat tag for each code needed for polyglot works. Give the
                     						language name in this element, if it is a specific variety of the language as identified using
                     						its three-letter ISO 6390-3 identifier, which should be given in \language_code.
                  </p>
                  <p>PLEASE make an effort to use and keep up to date the Ethnologue code identification of
                     						collections, rather than using an entity developed code for individual languages, as entity
                     						specific codes become confusing or misleading when removed from the immediate entity context.

                  <p>PROVENANCE: 1) The individual, department or agency that created, accumulated, maintained and/or
                     						used materials (data sources, documents). 2) Information regarding the origin and custodial
                     						history of documents or data sources. The Principle of Provenance (also known as &#8220;respect des
                     						fonds&#8221;), a foundational principle of archives management, is that materials of the same
                     						provenance must not be intermingled with those of any other provenance. It is the principle of
                     						provenance that is the basis for arranging and storing materials by language project (as the
                     						original setting of creation and accumulation), rather than extracting and collocating all
                     						grammar materials, all anthropology materials, all instances of a shell book, etc. into topical
                     						collections in the archives.
                  </p>
                  <p>Unlike a library, which usually organizes works by topic, the archive should organize materials
                     						by common origin or provenance.... In general, it is best to keep collections together as a
                     						physical unit (as much as the different types of media permit), with each language program
                     						collection stored on its own computer media unit (such as CD-R), or all together in adjacent
                     						paper files. This most easily enables a particular team to see what has been submitted in the
                     						past and maintains the physical integrity of each collection consistently for archives
                     						management procedures.... the archives should not mix materials from different
                     						collections...according to...topical categories.

                  <p>Recommended best practice is to identify a Publisher by means of a name in a form that is ready
                     						for sorting within an index. For the names of persons, this means that the name should be given
                     						in inverted order with the surname first. For the names of organizations, this means that any
                     						initial article should be omitted.

                  <p>Copyright statement should be in text of element, not in the &#8216;code&#8217;

                  <p>Additional good practice guidance is needed regarding parameters of protection: duration of

                  <p>Examples of a Publisher include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, the name of a
                     						Publisher should be used to indicate the entity. [<a href="#DCMT">DCMT</a>]
                  </p>
                  <p>Content (documents, web pages&#8212;text, graphics, streaming audio and video) created for and
                     						published on the World Wide Web on a sanctioned entity site comprises a special class of
                     						published materials. Web content of a more document-like nature (a specific title, a credited
                     						author, and a date), such as an electronic working paper series, should be archived, and can
                     						usually be handled similarly to a print publication. Articles written by SIL authors for
                     						electronic journals or other formal web publications on other web sites should also be archived.
                     						Materials initially published in print (or on audio cassette, etc.) and converted for the web
                     						should be elsewhere included in the archives collection, though the new computer form (PDF,
                     						HTML, MP3) might also be suitable for maintaining as a presentation form.
                  </p>
                  <p>Caring for unpublished resources of long term value ... Language data, either in lexical form (a
                     						database) or as a text (with documentation) is more and more sought after as input for
                     						computational linguistic analysis. Descriptions and analyses are also desirable, if they are of
                     						reasonably good quality (e.g. consultant checked). Translation by-products, such as key terms
                     						papers and back translations, can be very useful to other teams in related languages. Language
                     						surveys and their supporting data are very valuable. Collected texts, recorded language data and
                     						transcriptions, if of sufficiently good quality, are also very valuable, as are photographs and
                     						slides, but the complexities resulting from lack of context (if not well documented) and ethical
                     						considerations add to the challenges of managing them in the archives .
                  </p>
                  <p>Being selective about what should be archived is important. Selectivity imposes an extra initial
                     						labor cost, but one which pays dividends in the short and long runs. For the submitter, being
                     						selective reduces the amount of material submitted, and therefore, reduces the burden of
                     						describing the material as well. For the archives, every object has a cost of storage, migration
                     						and management, which is balanced against its short and long term value. Is this a work that
                     						will be useful or informative in the future? Is it unique? Is it something that can no longer be
                     						obtained elsewhere? Is it reasonably good quality? &#8216;Yes&#8217; to these indicates that a work is
                     						probably worth keeping.

                  <p>In general, element properties&#8212;the labels, definitions, and range sets, should not be changed.
                     						However, two of the properties that may be changed are the font used for a specific field, and
                     						the language properties assigned to the field. This is the way that a field can be made to use a
                     						different (Unicode compliant) font and specific rules for word breaks, etc. that differ from
                     						those applied to other fields.A good candidate for customizing this way is the \title field, or
                     						the \alternative field. Keep in mind that all instances of that field will use the same font.
                     						The font should be a Unicode compliant font, not a legacy font that substitutes some characters
                     						with other characters (characters with different meanings, not just different representations).
                     						A custom font that has been developed to render Unicode characters better than or not available
                     						in generic Unicode fonts like Arial Unicode MS or Doulos SIL may be used. Be sure to document
                     						the font itself as a resource, and include it among the computer files of your collection. If
                     						these are foreign concepts, then don&#8217;t worry about this.

                     						relationships, version relationships, dependency relationships, and so on. When the related
                     						resource is also in a participating archive, the reference to the related resource should be by
                     						means of an "oai:" identifier. A Relation that begins with "oai:" should be presented by service
                     						providers as an active link that retrieves the metadata for that resource.

                     						for derived works. The <i>isVersionOf</i> refinement is used when the present resource is a new
                     						version or edition with added intellectual content that has been developed by the same creators.
                     						When the new version is nothing more than a rendition in a new format, then the

                     						and he/she was not in the employ of an entity language project. (Do not include SIL

                  <p>Texts and recordings are collected by a language worker often based on an assumption of private
                     						use for research. However, they are the intellectual property of someone else. The original
                     						writer or speaker, or perhaps the language community as a body, might want to assert ownership
                     						if texts or recordings are used for a purpose besides the original collector&#8217;s private study. To
                     						publish or otherwise distribute these works should have the approval of the owner&#8212;the creator.
                     						Because of this, special documentation is needed in an archives context. For language texts it
                     						is wise to document the speaker&#8217;s name, basic demographic information , the context in which
                     						collecting took place, and the date.

                  <p>Photographs, similarly, are usually taken in a context assuming private use, unless a media
                     						person explicitly states other intentions. Though the photograph is the intellectual property of

                  <p>This legal definition elucidates the sense of "derived" that is intended in the Dublin Core
                     						definition of Source. Note, however, that this overlaps with <a href="#Relation">Relation</a>, since the
                     							<i>isFormatOf</i> and <i>isVersionOf</i> refinements both refer to derivative works in the

                     						different <a href="#Type">Type</a> or <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> or <a href="#Title">Title</a> than the Source
                     						resource. When the difference from the original work is only a difference of <a href="#Date">Date</a>

                              								language, use this scheme to identify what kind of information it is from a linguistic
                              								standpoint.

                           <p>Linguistic Type extension of the Type element should only be used if a resource
                              								represents one of the structural types in the range set. The element may be repeated if
                              								a resource represents more than one linguistic type. So, for example, a primary text
                              								accompanied by a lexicon of vocabulary items would be described as both a primary text
                              								and a lexicon. In many cases, adequate description of a linguistic resource will require
                              								that the Linguistic Type extension be used in conjunction with the Discourse Type
                              								extension of the Type element, or the Linguistic extension of the Subject element. For
                              								example, a narrative text might be described as both a primary text (OLAC Linguistic
                              								Type) and a narrative (OLAC Discourse Type).
