         <p>In section 3, many points clarified regarding individual elements, particularly Creator, Contributor,
            Coverage, Description, Language, and Subject, in response to review by Metadata Working Group (see
               <url>http://www.language-archives.org/wg/metadata/Issues 2007-12.htm</url>). Examples expanded and added.
            Section 5 on the granularity of resources was added.</p>

         <heading>Introduction</heading>
         <p>This document provides guidelines on how to describe language resources using the OLAC metadata standard
               <cit>OLAC-Metadata</cit>. The standard itself documents the formal syntax of valid metadata records, but
            does not explain or exemplify the use of the individual metadata elements. That is the purpose of this
            document. </p>
         <p>Section 2 below describes the usage of the attributes that may be used on metadata elements. Section 3 then
            describes usage in the OLAC context for the fifteen core elements of the Dublin Core metadata set. Section 4
            describes other elements that may be used. Section 5 concludes with remarks about the granularity of
            resources; that is, it addresses the question of what size of thing (from file up to entire corpus) is
            treated as an item in an OLAC repository.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <heading>All elements</heading>
         <p>OLAC metadata is an application of the Dublin Core metadata element set as defined in <cit>DCMT</cit>. The
            most fundamental requirement on best practice in OLAC is that each element should be used in a way that
            conforms to its definition in <cit>DCMT</cit>. This document therefore repeats those definitions and offers
            usage notes and examples to help the reader understand best use of the elements in the context of describing
            language resources.</p>
         <p>Eight of the elements in the Dublin Core metadata set define refinements that narrow the meaning of the
            element. A refinement shares the meaning of the generic element, but with a more restricted scope. When the
            more restricted meaning applies, it is recommended best practice to use the refined version of an element
            rather than the generic one. This document lists the refinements that are possible for each element.</p>
         <p>In theory, every element in the metadata set may use the <i>xsi:type</i> attribute to specify an encoding
            scheme that defines a controlled vocabulary or a controlled syntax for its values. This document lists
            possible encoding schemes for eleven of the elements, whether defined by <cit>DCMT</cit> or
               <cit>OLAC-Extensions</cit>. In the case of the OLAC extensions, the controlled value goes in the
               <i>olac:code</i> attribute (with the element content being available for an optional freeform elaboration
            of the coded value), while in the case of DCMI encoding schemes the controlled value goes in the element
            content. When one of these encoding schemes is applicable, it is recommended best practice to use it since
            this adds precision to the value of the element that can be exploited to improve accuracy in searching and
            to provide domain-specific services. Subcommunities may follow the extension mechanism defined in section 5
            of <cit>OLAC-Metadata</cit> to define new encoding schemes.</p>
         <p>Every element in the metadata set may use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute. It specifies the language in which
            the text in the content of the element (the metadata itself) is written. The value for the attribute should
            be a three-letter code from the ISO 639-3 controlled vocabulary as defined in <cit>OLAC-Language</cit>. In
            the absence of an <i>xml:lang</i> attribute, the element content is assumed to be in English (unless it is a
            coded value from an encoding scheme). Whenever the language of the element content is other than English,
            recommended best practice is to use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute to identify the language. By using
            multiple instances of a metadata elements tagged for different languages, data providers may offer their
            metadata records in multiple languages. The use of the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute as the language of the
            metadata should not be confused with the use of the <i>olac:language</i> scheme with <xref>Language</xref>
            and <xref>Subject</xref> to specify, respectively, the content language of the resource itself and the
            subject of the resource. In fact, the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute may be used within these elements, as well,
            to specify an alternative name of the identified language, given in the language specified in
            <i>xml:lang</i> (see <xref>Language</xref> for an example).</p>
         <p>In the formal definition of the metadata standard <cit>OLAC-Metadata</cit>, every element and refinement is
            optional and repeatable. However, recommended best practice (as described below for particular elements and
            in <cit>OLAC-BP</cit>) requires that certain elements be present in order to give a basic breadth of
            description for a language resource. Recommended best practice also requires that one particular element
            (namely, <xref>Title</xref>) not be repeated. Since all other elements and refinements are repeatable,
            multiple values for an element or refinement should be given in multiple instances of the XML element rather
            than being listed in a single instance. This makes it possible for service providers to build search indexes
            on the individual values.</p>
         <p>To summarize, the following are recommended best practices that apply to all elements:</p>
         <element name="All elements">
            <definition><!-- Don't use. Just a trick to make export to RED/bpr.xml work. --></definition>
            <comment><!-- Ditto. --></comment>
            <bp>
               <p>Recommended best practice is for the value of each metadata element to conform to the definition of
                  that element as given in <cit>DCMT</cit>.</p>
               <p>When the meaning of a particular element in a metadata record fits the definition of a refinement,
                  recommended best practice is to use the refinement rather than the generic element.</p>
               <p>When applicable, recommended best practice is to use the <i>xsi:type</i> attribute to specify an
                  encoding scheme so as to express the value of the element with precision.</p>
               <p>Whenever the language of the element content is other than English, recommended best practice is to
                  use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute with a value from <cit>OLAC-Language</cit> to identify the language.</p>
               <p>When a resource has more than one value for a particular metadata element or refinement, recommended
                  best practice is to use a separate instance of the element or refinement for each value rather than
                  listing all the values in a single instance.</p>

         <heading>Core elements</heading>
         <p>Each of the fifteen core elements of the Dublin Core metadata set is described in one of the following
            subsections. These elements are defined in the <url>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</url> namespace for
            which the prefix <tt>dc:</tt> is used in the examples.</p>
         <p>Each subsection heading gives the name of an element; the element is then described under six subheadings.
               <i>Definition</i> is the definition for the element as given by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
               <cit>DCMT</cit>. <i>Refinements</i> lists the refined element names that may be used in place of the
            generic element name to specify a more precise meaning for the metadata item. The refinement definitions are
            copied from <cit>DCMT</cit>. All of the refinements are defined within the
            <url>http://purl.org/dc/terms/</url> namespace for which the prefix <tt>dcterms:</tt> is used in the
            examples. <i>Schemes</i> lists the encoding schemes that may be used with the element (or its refinements)
            as the value of the <i>xsi:type</i> attribute. <i>Best practice</i> lists the best practices for the use of
            the element that are recommended by the OLAC community <cit>OLAC-BP</cit>. <i>Usage notes</i> offers
            additional notes for the OLAC community on how to use the element in the context of describing language
            resources. <i>Examples</i> shows samples of properly encoded elements and sample refinements.</p>

         <element name="Contributor">
            <definition>An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource.</definition>
            <comment>

               <p>A Contributor may be a person, an organization, or a service&#x2014;any entity that has sufficient
                  involvement in the creation or development of the resource to warrant explicit identification.
                  Contributor is closely related to <xref>Creator</xref>. While a case for distinguishing the usage of
                  the two elements can be made based on the degree of responsibility for the content, the application of
                  the <i>olac:role</i> schema to the Contributor element, with its more precise vocabulary for the
                  nature of the contribution made by the entity identified, makes drawing a distinction between the less
                  precise concepts of Contributor and Creator much less significant. Thus, it is more straightforward to
                  consider Creator to be a refinement of the Contributor element, or even deprecate the use of the
                  Creator element altogether. The latter choice may be made by individual archives, but OLAC usage will
                  continue to support Creator as a valid element. See the discussion of <xref>Creator</xref> for more on
                  its use.</p>
               <p>Contributor and <xref>Publisher</xref> are also somewhat related elements. In particular, the
                     <i>olac:role</i> “sponsor” can come close to one aspect of participation that a publisher may have
                  in regard to making a given resource available to the public. The <i>olac:role</i> “editor” can
                  encompass a spectrum of tasks that are collectively performed by the publisher of a work. A sponsor or
                  editor that is not also the formal publisher of a resource may be entered in a Contributor element
                  (with the proper <i>olac:role</i> specified), but the publisher should not be repeated in a
                  Contributor element.</p>
               <p>The form of a personal name should follow the form in which the person's name would normally be listed
                  in an authoritative alphabetical list in his or her own language or country of residence or primary
                  activity, <i>e.g.</i> “FamilyName, GivenName” for an English speaker. If the first element is the
                  family name, follow the family name with a comma. If the first element is the given name, do not
                  follow it with a comma. Consult the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd ed., rev., <cit>AACR2r</cit>
                  chapter 22 for additional guidance in determining entry elements and the normal ordering and forms of
                  names based on language and country, as well as other name characteristics.</p>
               <p>Be consistent with corporate name forms (names of institutions and other corporate bodies). Names that
                  include a primary unit and subsidiary unit should be ordered with the primary unit given first.
                  Location should generally be omitted from the name unless location is an integral part of the proper
                  name of the unit. Do not use quotation marks to enclose corporate names. If the name is a translation
                  from its usual form or is not usually given in English, use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute on the
                  element. More guidance on the forms of corporate names may be found in <cit>AACR2r</cit>, chapter 24.</p>
               <p>In general, if there is no suitable role in the <i>olac:role</i> scheme, no additional information
                  regarding the particular role of the contributor should be included in content of the element, as this
                  would have the effect of making separate indexed forms for the same person based on engaging in
                  different kinds of contributory activities.</p>

                     <p>The <i>olac:role</i> scheme is optionally used to specify the role (such as transcriber,
                        sponsor, and so on) played by the named entity in the creation of the resource. The role is
                        expressed by means of a controlled vocabulary; see <cit>OLAC-Role</cit> for the definition of
                        the vocabulary. </p>

               <p>Recommended best practice is to identify a Contributor by means of a name in a form that is ready for
                  sorting within an index. For the names of organizations, this means that any initial article should be
                  omitted. </p>
               <p>Recommended best practice is to use the <i>olac:role</i> scheme to indicate the role of the

         <element name="Coverage">
            <definition>The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the
               jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.</definition>
            <comment>
               <p> Coverage will typically include spatial location (a place name or geographic coordinates), temporal
                  period (a period label, date, or date range) or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity).
                     <cit>DCMT</cit></p>
               <p>Coverage is related to <xref>Subject</xref> in having a topical orientation. Coverage in its temporal
                  aspect should not be confused with <xref>Date</xref> or one of its refinements (<i>e.g.</i>, created,
                  or available). Thus, a data set that was compiled over an extended period of time should be described
                  via a <tt>dcterms:created</tt> element whose content is a date range, rather than with Coverage or
                     <tt>dcterms:temporal</tt>. A data set (or any kind of resource) that contains or addresses
                  historical information would correctly use Coverage or <tt>dcterms:temporal</tt> to specify the date,
                  date range or period in focus.</p>
               <p>Coverage should be used geographically when the language variety in focus in the resource
                  has a different or narrower distribution than the language has in general. It should also be used when
                  the resource deals with a topic of study in which the location or region itself is in focus,
                  <i>e.g.</i>, multilingualism, language policy, languages in contact, in a given locale.</p>
               <p>Geospatial coordinates are appropriate Coverage metadata for a text recording when they identify the
                  location where the exemplified speech variety is spoken. Typically this coincides with the location
                  where the text was collected, but not always. If the text was collected outside a community where it
                  is spoken (such as in a laboratory setting), then information about the circumstances of collection
                  would be included in the Description element. </p>

               <p>Recommended best practice is that a metadata record should contain at least one Coverage (or one of
                  its refinements) or Description (or one of its refinements) or Subject element in order to give the

         <element name="Creator">
            <definition>An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.</definition>
            <comment>
               <p>A Creator may be a person, an organization, or a service. Creator is closely related to
                     <xref>Contributor</xref>. Creator, though still rather generic, is to be understood as being
                  strongly indicative of significant involvement in the creation of the resource. OLAC recommendation is
                  that Creator be viewed semantically as a <i>refinement</i> of Contributor, though it retains its
                  status (and therefore its syntax) as an element for backward compatibility. Thus, Creator is
                  appropriate to use in cases where the entity to be identified has significant involvement as a primary
                  originator of the resource, but in such a way that none of the role terms available in the
                     <i>olac:role</i> scheme is a suitable description of that involvement. Examples are an artist
                  (sculptor, carver, weaver) or a modeler.</p>
               <p>The semantic redefinition of the Creator element as being equivalent to a refinement of Contributor
                  has support in the wider community. The DCMI's Library Application Profile <cit>DC-Lib</cit> make this
                  recommendation. In view of this treatment, if Creator is used, it should be used without a role
                  refinement term.</p>
               <p>A participating OLAC repository may decide to deprecate the use of Creator, in favor of exclusively
                  using Contributor. Such a decision would not conflict with OLAC recommended best practice, but it
                  should be recognized that other metadata schemas and application profiles built on the Dublin Core
                  foundation may use Creator (and possibly require a Creator element), so that crosswalks between OLAC
                  and another metadata schema may involve the mapping of certain OLAC Contributor roles to the Creator
                  element in the other schema.</p>
               <p>Additional information about the proper form of entry for a personal name or a corporate name may be
                  found under the <xref>Contributor</xref> element.</p>

            <bp>
               <p>Recommended best practice is to use the Contributor element described above instead, except in cases
                  where there is significant creative involvement by the person or organization, but there is no
                  suitable <cit>OLAC-Role</cit> refinement term.</p>

            <comment>
               <p>A WSCDTF-conformant value may be for the year alone, for the year and month, or for an exact date. A
                  range of years is also a valid value; in this case both years must be four-digit values and the
                  earliest year should come first. Thus, the element value may match one of the four following patterns:
                     <tt>YYYY</tt>, <tt>YYYY-MM</tt>, <tt>YYYY-MM-DD</tt>, or <tt>YYYY-YYYY</tt>.</p>
               <p>A Date with no refinement will be assumed to be the date of issue (<i>i.e.</i> publication). Date of
                  publication may differ from its creation date; thus it can be helpful to prospective users to include
                  more than one kind of Date element (refinement). However, a single resource should not have more than
                  one instance of each date refinement, with the possible exception of <tt>dcterms:modified</tt>. Where
                  the modification history of a resource is significant, it is appropriate to enter this information in
                  a <xref>Provenance</xref> element, which allows for explanation of modifications in a way that
                     <tt>dcterms:modified</tt> does not.</p>
               <p>‘Available’ as a refinement pertains to Date, not to other aspects of availability.</p>
               <p>Do not use additional terms such as “recorded on” or “donated on” in the element text.</p>

               <p> Description element is not a “catch-all” category. The Description element should not be confused

                  Headings, or Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts thesaurus descriptors. Description should

               <p>Typically, Format may include the media-type, physical material, and/or dimensions of the resource.
                  Format may be used to determine the software, hardware or other equipment needed to display or operate

               <p>In the case of a physical object, the refinements medium and extent are most applicable. These may

                  35 mm slide; NTSC encoded VHS cassette), and the size/duration (<i>e.g.</i> number of pages and

               <p>Format (and its refinement 'medium'), which encompasses the notion of physical media categories such

                  as links in user interfaces. Complete relative link paths with the base server so that the link will
                  be valid outside the search system of the host archives.</p>
               <p>Identifier is of particular value in enabling other resources to unambiguously refer to the resource
                  in focus in terms of a specific relationship. See <xref>Relation</xref> for best practice and usage
                  notes in creating relationship links between resources.</p>
               <p>When using the <i>bibliographicCitation</i> refinement, there is no prescription as to a bibliographic
                  style to use in forming the citation. The only requirement is that sufficient bibliographic detail be
                  included to identify the resource unambiguously.</p>
               <p>A unique identifier that has been assigned to a digital resource by the researcher, a research
                  organization or department, or an archives or library for internal reference may continue to be useful
                  in identifying the resource alongside a URI assigned in the context of a digital repository. Such a
                  unique identifier may be significant for continuity of identification for a digital resource
                  throughout its lifecycle, as other resources may have used such an identifier in referencing the
                  object prior to the assignment of the URI later in its lifecycle.</p>
               <p>Do not specify the “oai:” identifier for the resource itself as a value of Identifier, since it is
                  already given in <tt>&lt;identifier&gt;</tt> in the <tt>&lt;header&gt;</tt> of the
                     <tt>&lt;record&gt;</tt>s returned by the OAI protocol.</p>
               <p>Do not use Identifier for a URL intended to direct the searcher to a <xref>Description</xref>,
                  availability or usage or other <xref>Rights</xref>-related information. A URI may be used in each of
                  those elements or refinements to link to such information. Likewise, Identifier should not be used to
                  refer to a general collection site in which the resource is one of many works available.</p>

            <definition>A language of the resource.</definition>
            <comment>
               <p>Language is used for a language the resource is in, as opposed to the language it describes (see
                     <xref>Subject</xref>). It is related to the audience for the work in that it identifies a language
                  that the creator of the resource assumes that its eventual user will understand. When a resource is in
                  more than one language, use a separate Language element for each language.</p>
               <p>For a resource of a particular Linguistic Type (see <xref>Type</xref>), the uses of the Language
                  element and the <xref>Subject</xref> element with the <i>olac:language</i> scheme (hereafter
                  referred to as “Subject.language”) can be generally described as follows:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><p>For Linguistic type Primary text: use the Language element to specify the language of the text. In
                  addition, if it is annotated, use a second Language element to specify the language in which the annotations
                  are made, as well as a Subject.language element repeating the language of the text, which is (in effect) the 
                  "subject" of the annotations.</p></li>
                  <li><p>For Linguistic type Lexicon: use Language for the language in which the definitions are written; use 
                     Subject.language for the language whose words are being defined. A bilingual dictionary 
                     may have both languages identified in both kinds of elements.</p></li>
                  <li><p>For Linguistic type Language description: use Language for the language the description is
                     written in, and use Subject.language to specify the language being described. In addition, if the resource
                     contains fairly extensive examples (i.e., full sentence-length examples, at a minimum) in the language 
                     being described, as might be the case with an extensive grammatical description, it might also be 
                     appropriate to use a Language element containing the language being described, as well.</p></li>
               </ul>   
               <p>For a work of literature or other monolingual document aimed at the speakers of a particular language,
                  use Language to identify that language. For a sound recording, use Language for the language being
                  spoken in the recording.</p>
               <p>Service providers should use the <i>code</i> attribute to support searches by language, and may use
                  the element content in searches by keyword. They also may supply the default language name in keyword
                  searching when the element content is missing.</p>

               <p>Recommended best practice is that every record contain at least one Language element. For a resource
                  that does not include language content, include a Language element containing the code <tt>zxx</tt>
                  for “No linguistic content.”</p>
               <p>Recommended best practice is to use the <i>olac:language</i> scheme with the Language element to
                  identify an individual language precisely. Specify the language in the <i>olac:code</i> attribute
                  while leaving the element content empty. Use the element content only when the controlled vocabulary
                  does not offer an appropriate code, or when further specification is needed, such as to name a
                  specific dialect or to give an alternate name that differs from the reference name given by the
                  controlled vocabulary.</p>

            <comment>
               <p>Examples of a Publisher include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, the name of a
                  Publisher should be used to indicate the entity. <cit>DCMT</cit> The Publisher is generally the
                  business, organization, or sometimes individual who takes responsibility (and provides financial and
                  production resources) for putting the resource into a form suitable for making it publicly available,
                  whether in multiple hard copies (printing, pressing of a disc, etc), by broadcasting (radio,
                  television, webcast), or posting to a public website. A published resource may be offered for sale or
                  freely, but in either case, it is released for public use. </p>
               <p>Many materials that are placed in archival repositories are not formally published in that they have
                  not undergone an editorial, composition and production process, involving review, modification, and
                  packaging by persons other than the original creator(s). While such items may be offered publicly,
                  they are not considered “published” in a formal sense and their metadata should not ordinarily specify
                  a publisher.</p>
               <p>For an entity that has funded the creation or development of the resource in some way, but has not
                  otherwise participated in its development through editing, composition, production, printing,
                  marketing, posting, etc., use the <xref>Contributor</xref> element specifying the <cit>OLAC-Role</cit>
                  code="sponsor".</p>
               <p>Be consistent with corporate name forms. Names that include a primary unit and subsidiary unit should
                  be ordered with the primary unit given first. Location should generally be omitted from the name
                  unless location is an integral part of the proper name of the unit.</p>
            </comment>
            <bp>
               <p>Recommended best practice is to identify a Publisher by means of a name in a form that is ready for
                  sorting within an index. For the names of persons, this means that the name should be given with the
                  surname first (<i>i.e.</i>, an “inverted” order for most Western name forms). For the names of
                  organizations, this means that any initial article should be omitted.</p>

                  relationships, version relationships, dependency relationships, and so on</p>
               <p>When the present resource is a derived work, the source resource is typically indicated by
                     <xref>Source</xref>. However, there are two cases in which refinements of Relation are used for
                  derived works. The <i>isVersionOf</i> refinement is used when the present resource is a new version or
                  edition with added intellectual content that has been developed by the same creators. When the new
                  version is nothing more than a rendition in a new format, then the <i>isForrmatOf</i> refinement is
                  used. </p>
               <p>Metadata that is migrated from the records of a collector or depositor or an earlier repository system
                  might make use of an identifier assigned at that earlier stage in specifying relationship information.
                  Relationships metadata using such internal identifiers in their referencing will be made more useful
                  if they are updated to the OAI identifier at such a time as the metadata for the related resource is
                  also migrated or uploaded to the OAI compliant system.</p>

               <p>When the related resource is also held in a participating archive, recommended best practice is to

               <p> Typically, a Rights element will contain a rights management statement for the resource, or reference
                  a service providing such information. Rights information often encompasses Intellectual Property
                  Rights (IPR), Copyright, and various Property Rights. If the Rights element is absent, no assumptions
                  can be made about the status of these and other rights with respect to the resource.
                  <cit>Copyright</cit></p>
               <p>A rights management statement that contains a license or directs a potential user to a license
                  statement that specifies conditions and granted permissions should use the <i>dcterms:license</i>
                  refinement. The <i>dcterms:accessRights</i> refinement should be used to document conditions under
                  which access to the resource is granted. In either case, a statement may be included directly within
                  the metadata, or a URI reference to the statement or a service may be given. Examples of license
                  statements can be found at Creative Commons <cit>CC</cit>.</p>
               <p>Use <xref>Rights Holder</xref> to specify a person or corporate body (organization, legally
                  constituted entity representing a group or community), rather than Rights.</p>
               <p>Copyright is inherent in primary linguistic and cultural research materials, such as stories,
                  descriptions, songs or art work, which researchers collect in the course of their work. The rights, in
                  most cases, belong to the creator—not the researcher or his organization or sponsor—or, in some cases,
                  to the language community (if it may be constituted as a legal entity). Intellectual property law as
                  it applies to personal or community cultural property is beyond the scope of these notes. However,
                  documenting the creators of such works, the conditions under which they came into the hands of the
                  researcher, and any known conditions on use (generally non-commercial use) are critical aspects of
                  archiving. To publish or otherwise distribute such works should have the approval of the owner. Only
                  with information about the origins and conditions of collecting can the holding repository or
                  interested researchers make use of such resources in ways that respect the rights and sensibilities of
                  those whose languages and communities are documented.</p>
               <p>A fundamental right of a creator is the right to be associated with his or her creation (whether
                  verbal, textual, visual, etc.), regardless of the retention or subsequent assignment of additional
                  rights (to display, distribute copies, modify). Upholding this right must be balanced with a person's
                  right to privacy with regard to identifying information (including the use of photographs).
                  Demographic data about a creator, contributor or research participant, along with identifying
                  information, is often included in research data. Identifying information may be removed prior to
                  deposit, or as a condition of release, or a Rights element may document a statement of permission to
                  use a resource or parts of a resource in a particular way that may otherwise have been an infringement
                  of privacy.</p>

               <p>The present resource may be derived from the Source resource in whole or in part. <cit>DCMT</cit>
               </p>
               <p> In the legal parlance of intellectual property rights, a “derivative work” is one that is based on
                  one or more preexisting works. This includes cases in which a work may be recast, transformed, or
                  adapted in any way, such as by translation, abridgement, dramatization, recording, transcription, or
                  digital encoding. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
                  modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship is also a derivative work
                     <cit>Copyright</cit>.</p>
               <p>This legal definition elucidates the sense of “derived” that is intended in the Dublin Core definition
                  of Source. Note, however, that this overlaps with <xref>Relation</xref>, since the <i>isFormatOf</i>
                  and <i>isVersionOf</i> refinements both refer to derivative works in the technical sense.</p>
               <p>Use Source (as opposed to one of the above two Relation refinements) in cases when the present
                  resource has a substantially different <xref>Type</xref> or <xref>Creator</xref> or <xref>Title</xref>
                  than the Source resource. When the difference from the original work is only a difference of
                     <xref>Date</xref> or <xref>Format</xref> or <xref>Publisher</xref> or <xref>Identifier</xref> or
                  edition, then use Relation (or the appropriate refinement) to encode the relationship to the original
                  work.</p>

            <comment>
               <p>Typically, a Subject will be expressed as keywords, key phrases or classification codes that describe
                  a topic of the resource. <cit>DCMT</cit></p>
               <p>For a resource of a particular Linguistic Type (see <xref>Type</xref>), the uses of the Subject element 
                  with the <i>olac:language</i> scheme (hereafter referred to as “Subject.language”) and the 
                  <xref>Language</xref> element can be generally described as follows:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><p>For Linguistic type Primary text: use the Language element to specify the language of the text. In
                     addition, if it is annotated, use a second Language element to specify the language in which the annotations
                     are made, as well as a Subject.language element repeating the language of the text, which is (in effect) the 
                     "subject" of the annotations.</p></li>
                  <li><p>For Linguistic type Lexicon: use Language for the language in which the definitions are written; use 
                     Subject.language for the language whose words are being defined. A bilingual dictionary 
                     may have both languages identified in both kinds of elements.</p></li>
                  <li><p>For Linguistic type Language description: use Language for the language the description is
                     written in, and use Subject.language to specify the language being described. In addition, if the resource
                     contains fairly extensive examples (i.e., full sentence-length examples, at a minimum) in the language 
                     being described, as might be the case with an extensive grammatical description, it might also be 
                     appropriate to use a Language element containing the language being described, as well.</p></li>
               </ul>   
               <p>Use of the <i>olac:language</i> scheme with Subject is also appropriate for works that are not of 
                  any particular <i>olac:linguistic-type</i>, but do treat a language or languages (or the communities
                  of their users) as a topic of study.</p>
               <p>To describe the spatial or temporal topic of the resource, use the <xref>Coverage</xref> element.</p>
               <p>The Subject element should not be confused with Description. Subject contains subject headings or
                  concise individual topic terms, while Description contains free-text, prose descriptions.</p>

               <p>Recommended best practice is that a metadata record should contain at least one Subject or Coverage

               <p>When the subject is a human language, recommended best practice is to use the <i>olac:language</i>
                  scheme with the Subject element to identify an individual language precisely. Specify the language
                  in the <i>olac:code</i> attribute while leaving the element content empty. Use the element content
                  only when the controlled vocabulary does not offer an appropriate code, or when further specification
                  is needed, such as to name a specific dialect or to give an alternate name that differs from the
                  reference name given by the controlled vocabulary. </p>
               <p>When the subject matter falls within the field of linguistics, recommended best practice is to use the
                     <i>olac:linguistic-field</i> scheme to identify the subfield.</p>

               <p>A translation of the title can be supplied in a <i>dcterms:alternative</i> element. Use the

               <p>A formal title (for catalogers, the title as found on a primary source of information), is generally 
                  expected to be in the language in which the work is written or recorded. If the title is in a language 
                  different from the language identified in a <xref>Language</xref> element, use the <i>xml:lang</i>
                  attribute on Title to specify the language in which the title is actually given.</p>
               <p>In the case of a polyglot work, where the text is given in two or more languages in some kind of

               <p>The Title can be a name given to a work to identify it if a formal title is not used, such as for a

               <p> Type includes terms describing general categories, functions, genres, or aggregation levels for
                  content. The DCMIType vocabulary specifies a controlled vocabulary to be used to with Type. These
                  relate to the intended use or mode of perception by a user, <i>e.g.</i>, whether it is read (as text),
                  viewed (as image), heard, etc. Thus, a computer image file of a text (such as a scanned document) is
                  type 'text', not type 'image', because the common use involves reading text. To describe the physical
                  or digital manifestation of the resource, use the <xref>Format</xref> element. <cit>DCMT</cit></p>

                  structural types in the range set. The element may be repeated if a resource represents more than one
                  linguistic type. So, for example, a primary text accompanied by a lexicon of vocabulary items would be
                  described as both a primary text and a lexicon. </p>
               <!-- <p>In the case of a primary text
                  (or collection of such texts), adequate description of a linguistic resource will require that 
                  Linguistic Type be specified in conjunction with the Discourse Type extension of the Type element, or the Linguistic
                  extension of the Subject element. For example, a narrative text might be described as both a
                  primary text (OLAC Linguistic Type) and a narrative (OLAC Discourse Type). </p> -->

         <heading>Granularity of resources</heading>
         <p>Determining the right degree of detail to apply at the level of an OLAC resource description involves
            multiple factors. The level of description appropriate for harvesting and inclusion in an aggregate catalog
            may be different (typically less) than the level of description desirable for the catalog of a specific
            institution's repository.</p>
         <p>For a resource that has been published in some form, the unit or grouping of publication usually corresponds
            to the appropriate unit of description for the OLAC record. However, many archival resources have not been
            formally published. For unpublished papers presenting findings of research, these closely parallel their
            published counterparts, and consitute similar kinds of units for archival description.</p>
         <p>For primary source materials (recordings, transcribed texts, data sets) the foremost factor in determining
            an appropriate unit of aggregation and description will be their provenance: does a particular body of
            resources have a shared provenance, or were they placed together at some point in time well after their
            creation (possibly by the repository itself)? If the latter, was there some coherent organizing principle or
            intermediate stage of development that is still relevant for the proper understanding and use of the
            resources, or would the grouping be motivated more by convenience of handling? Situations of shared
            provenance that constitute a collective unit or collection for description purposes will be distinguished by
            the high degree of commonality of metadata elements, <i>e.g.</i>, same researcher(s), author(s), subject
            language(s), content (or analysis) language(s), approximate date, coverage, linguistic type, general
            description. Other metadata elements that are also important for resource discovery but that may differ at
            this level (<i>e.g.</i>, discourse type) can be repeated at the OLAC description level for as many types as
            are prominently included. Alternatively, the collection may be divided into sub-collections by discourse
            genre, or other significant feature. The sub-collections can then be treated in distinct OLAC records.
            Further characteristics, such as topic, additional contributors, and event specifics, can be documented at a
            finer level of granularity by creating a second level of “collection description” which includes more detail
            on the individual units (specific recordings or texts), included as a part of the (sub-)collection in an
            expanded, structured contents description document. This second level of description typically aligns with
            the session level detail of <cit>IMDI</cit> description.</p>
         <p>Some OLAC elements may be applicable at this secondary level, but other possible aspects of descriptions may
            be quite unique to the collection of materials in hand. For example, it could be valuable to document the
            orthography used for a given written text (whether transcription or original writing) in a collection where
            different orthographies are represented. It is at this second level that the description becomes something
            of its own creative endeavor, as the collection's compiler or the archivist creating this level of
            description seeks to offer additional detail in an organized way that will enhance the utility of the
            collection for future researchers.</p>
         <p>Materials without a common provenance generally should not be grouped either within the repository or for
            OLAC description.</p>
         <p>The timing of acquisition of materials, whether they are received as a group at one point in time or accrue
            (are submitted to the repository) over a period of time, is a second significant factor in determining the
            units of grouping for OLAC level description. Materials that are collected together and organized by some
            knowledgeable person (perhaps the original researcher, perhaps not) may properly constitute a single
            collection (as a single unit of OLAC description) with a complex secondary level of collection description.
            Yet those same materials, had they been deposited periodically over time, might just as well constitute
            numerous smaller units, each with its own OLAC level descriptive record.</p>
