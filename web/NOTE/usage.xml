         <heading>Introduction</heading>
         <p>This document provides guidelines on how to describe language resources using
            the OLAC metadata standard <cit>OLAC-Metadata</cit>. The standard itself
            documents the formal syntax of valid metadata records, but does not explain or
            exemplify the use of the individual metadata elements. That is the purpose of
            this document. </p>
         <p>Section 2 below describes the usage of the attributes that may be used on
            metadata elements. Section 3 then describes usage in the OLAC context for the
            fifteen core elements of the Dublin Core metadata set. Section 4 describes
            other elements that may be used..</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <heading>All elements</heading>
         <p>Four attributes&#8212;<i>refine, code, scheme,</i> and
            <i>lang</i>&#8212;are used throughout the XML implementation of the
            metadata elements. A fifth attribute, <i>langs,</i> is used on complete
            metadata records. These are described in turn below.</p>
         <p> Some elements in the OLAC metadata set use the <i>refine</i> attribute to
            identify element refinements. These qualifiers make the meaning of an element
            narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the
            unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope <cit>DC-Q</cit>. When an
            element does use a <i>refine</i> attribute, the possible values for the
            attribute are restricted to a specified controlled vocabulary.</p>
         <p>Some elements in the OLAC metadata set use the <i>code</i> attribute to hold
            metadata values that are taken from a specific encoding scheme. The attribute
            value is always a precise value taken from a controlled vocabulary or a formal
            notation that is described in another OLAC document. As a result, all service
            providers are able to interpret uniformly the meaning of any <i>code</i>
            value. The terms of a controlled vocabulary are also incorporated into the XML
            schema for OLAC metadata; thus every <i>code</i> value is tested for validity
            when the OLAC registration server tests a data provider for conformance to
            OLAC standards <cit>OLAC-Registration</cit>. For elements that have a
            <i>code</i> attribute, the element content may also be used to specify a
            freeform elaboration of the coded value.</p>
         <p>Every element in the OLAC metadata set may use the <i>scheme</i> attribute. It
            specifies a standardized name for the scheme that constrains how the text in
            the content of the element is encoded. A scheme may be a controlled vocabulary
            or a formal notation. Recommended best practice is to confine the value of
               <i>scheme</i> to the label for one of the encoding schemes registered with
            the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative <cit>DCMI-Registry</cit>. Members of the
            OLAC community who want to use an unregistered scheme should submit it for
            registration <cit>DCMI-Submit</cit>. When OLAC data providers are tested for
            conformance to OLAC recommended best practice, only the value of the
            <i>scheme</i> attribute is tested for inclusion in the list of registered
            schemes. OLAC does not test the actual element content for conformance to the
            scheme; a service provider for a subcommunity that has developed a particular
            scheme could perform such a test. </p>
         <p>Every element in the OLAC metadata set may use the <i>lang</i> attribute. It
            specifies the language in which the text in the content of the element is
            written. The value for the attribute comes from the controlled vocabulary
            defined by <cit>OLAC-Language</cit>. By default, the <i>lang</i> attribute has
            the value "en", for English. Whenever the language of the element content is
            other than English, recommended best practice is to use the <i>lang</i>
            attribute to identify the language. By using multiple instances of the
            metadata elements tagged for different languages, data providers may offer
            their metadata records in multiple languages. </p>
         <p>The <i>langs</i> attribute is used on the <tt>&lt;olac&gt;</tt>
            element&#8212;the container for all the metadata elements of a given
            metadata record. It lists the languages in which the metadata record is
            designed to be read. This attribute holds a space-delimited list of language
            codes from the <cit>OLAC-Language</cit> controlled vocabulary. By default,
            this attribute has the value "en", for English, indicating that the record is
            aimed only at English readers. If an explicit value is given for the
            attribute, then the record is aimed at readers of all the languages listed.</p>
         <p>Service providers should use this information in order to offer localized
            views of the metadata. When a metadata record lists only one language, then
            all elements should be displayed (regardless of their individual languages),
            unless the user has requested to suppress all records in that language. When a
            metadata record has multiple alternative languages, the user should be able to
            select one and have display of elements in the other languages suppressed. An
            element in a language not included in the list of alternatives should always
            be displayed (for instance, the vernacular title of a work).</p>
         <p>In a given metadata record, every element is optional and every element is
            repeatable.</p>
         <element name="All elements">
            <definition><!-- Don;t use. Just a trick to make export to RED/bpr.xml work. --></definition>
            <comment><!-- Ditto. --></comment>
            <bp>
               <p>Whenever the language of the element content is
                  other than English, recommended best practice is
                  to use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute with a value from <cit>ISO639-3</cit> to identify the
                  language.</p>
               <p>When a resource has more than one value for a particular metadata
                  element, recommended best practice is to use a separate instance of the
                  metadata element for each instance rather than listing all the values in
                  a single instance.</p>

         <heading>Individual elements</heading>
         <p>Each of the core elements of the Dublin Core metadata set is described in one of the following
            subsections. The heading gives the name of the
            element; the element is then described under six subheadings.
            <i>Definition</i> is the definition for the element as given by the Dublin
            Core Metadata Initiative <cit>DCMT</cit>.
            <i>Refinements</i> lists the refined element names (from the <i>dcterms</i>
            namespace) that may be used in place of the generic element name to specify a
            more precise meaning for the metadata item. The refinement definitions are copied from  <cit>DCMT</cit>.
            <i>Schemes</i> lists the encoding schemes that may be used with this element
            (or its refinements) as the value of the <i>xsi:type</i> attribute.
            <i>Best practices</i> lists the best practices for the use of this element
            that are recommended by the OLAC community <cit>OLAC-BP</cit>. 
            <i>Usage notes</i> offers additional notes for the OLAC community
            on how to use the element in the context of describing language resources. 
            <i>Examples</i> shows samples of
            properly encoded elements and sample refinements.</p>
         <element name="Contributor">
         	<definition>An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource.</definition>
            <comment>
               <p>A Contributor may be a person, an organization, or a service.
                  Contributor is closely related to <xref>Creator</xref>. The difference
                  has to do with degree of responsibility for the content. The Contributor
                  designation is used for those entities whose role in the creation of the
                  resource is not great enough to merit recognition as a primary source of
                  the intellectual content. This element may be used to identify
                  institutions that sponsored or funded the work. It may be used to
                  identify individuals who played a secondary role in the development of
                  the resource. As a rule of thumb, Creator is used when the contribution
                  is such that it would be cited in the "author" field of a bibliographic
                  entry, and Contributor is used otherwise.</p>

                     <p>The <i>refine</i> attribute is optionally used to specify the role
                        (such as transcriber, sponsor, and so on) played by the named
                        entity in the creation of the resource. The role is expressed by
                        means of a controlled vocabulary; see <cit>OLAC-Role</cit> for the

           	<p>Recommended best practice is to identify the entity by means of a name
           		and to give the name in a form that is ready for sorting within an
           		index. For the names of persons, this means that the name should be
           		given in inverted order with the surname first. For the names of
           		organizations, this means that any initial article should be omitted.
           		When a resource has more than one contributor, use a separate
           		Contributor element for each one.</p>

         <element name="Coverage">
         	<definition>The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.</definition>
            <comment>
               <p> Coverage will typically include spatial location (a place name or
                  geographic coordinates), temporal period (a period label, date, or date
                  range) or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity).
                     <cit>DCMT</cit></p>
               <p>In the OLAC context, service providers already have a database that maps
                  languages to the countries in which they are spoken
                  <cit>OLAC-Language</cit>. Coverage should not be used to duplicate this
                  information; rather service providers will support searches concerning
                  languages spoken in a given country by referring to the language
                  database. Coverage should be used geographically only when the language
                  involved has a wide distribution and the resource focuses on its use in
                  a particular region or geopolitical jurisdiction, or conversely, when
                  the resource deals with a region that encompasses multiple languages.

               <p>The <i>code</i> attribute is used to hold a standardized encoding
                  of a date. Following <cit>DCMT</cit>, OLAC uses the YYYY-MM-DD
                  format as defined in <cit>W3CDTF</cit>. When a month or day value
                  is less than 10, use a leading 0 to maintain a two-digit length.
                  The encoded value may be for the year alone, for the year and
                  month, or for an exact date. A range of years is also a valid
                  value for this attribute; in this case both years must be
                  four-digit values and the earliest year should come first. Thus,
                  the encoded value may match one of the four following patterns:
                  <tt>YYYY</tt>, <tt>YYYY-MM</tt>, <tt>YYYY-MM-DD</tt>, or

            	<p>Web content of a more document-like nature (a specific title, a credited author, and a date), such as an electronic working paper series, should be archived, and can usually be handled similarly to a print publication.

Materials initially published in print (or on audio cassette, etc.) and converted for the web should be elsewhere included in the archives collection, though the new computer form (PDF, HTML, MP3) might also be suitable for maintaining as a presentation form.</p>

                  want to pull out a subset of MIME types. We also may want to add some
                  new categories and subtypes for our purposes in order to cover archive
                  holdings that are not digital, e.g. manuscript, print, microform, and so
                  on. The library or archive world probably has such a controlled

               <p>Language is used for a language the resource is in, as opposed to the
                  language it describes (see <xref>Subject.language</xref>). It is related
                  to the audience for the work in that it identifies a language that the
                  creator of the resource assumes that its eventual user will understand.
                  When a resource is in more than one language, use a separate Language
                  element for each language.</p>
               <p>For a work of literature or other monolingual document aimed at the
                  speakers of a particular language, use Language to identify that
                  language. For a sound recording, use Language for the language being
                  spoken in the recording. For a grammatical description, for instance,
                  use Language for the language the grammar is written in; use
                  Subject.language for the language whose grammar is being described. For
                  an annotated text, use Language for the language in which the
                  annotations are made; use Subject.language for the language of the base
                  text that is being annotated. For a dictionary, use Language for the
                  language in which the definitions are written; use Subject.language for
                  the language whose words are being defined.</p>

         		<p>Unlike a library, which usually organizes works by topic, the archive should organize materials by common origin or provenance. In general, it is best to keep collections together as a physical unit (as much as the different types of media permit), with each language program collection stored on its own computer media unit (such as CD-R), or all together in adjacent paper files. This most easily enables a particular team to see what has been submitted in the past and maintains the physical integrity of each collection consistently for archives management procedures.</p>

                  instance, part-whole relationships, version relationships, dependency
                  relationships, and so on. When the related resource is also in a
                  participating archive, the reference to the related resource should be
                  by means of an "oai:" identifier. A Relation that begins with "oai:"
                  should be presented by service providers as an active link that
                  retrieves the metadata for that resource.</p>
               <p>For a required markup definition (like a DTD or Schema) use
                     <xref>Format.markup</xref> rather than Relation. When the required
                  software or hardware can be inferred from the <xref>Format</xref> of the
                  resource, do not also use Relation for this purpose.</p>
               <p>When the present resource is a derived work, the source resource is
                  typically indicated by <xref>Source</xref>. However, there are two cases
                  in which refinements of Relation are used for derived works. The
                     <i>isVersionOf</i> refinement is used when the present resource is a
                  new version or edition with added intellectual content that has been
                  developed by the same creators. When the new version is nothing more
                  than a rendition in a new format, then the <i>isForrmatOf</i> refinement
                  is used. </p>

            	<p>Copyrights are also inherent in primary linguistic and cultural research materials, such as stories, descriptions, songs or art work, which researcher collect in the course of their work. The rights, in most cases, belong to the creator—not the researcher or SIL—or, in some cases, to the language community (as a legal entity). Intellectual property law as it applies to community cultural property is not yet well-defined and is beyond the scope of these guidelines. However, documenting the creators of such works and the conditions under which they came into the hands of an SIL worker are critical steps in archiving these valuable works. Only with this information about their origins can SIL follow through on its intention to respect the intellectual property rights of vernacular language communities in which we work.</p>
