<h2><A name="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The vision of OLAC is that "any user on the Internet should be able to go to a single gateway to find all
            the language resources available at all participating institutions" (see vision statement in
               [<a href="#OLAC-Process">OLAC-Process</a>]). The ability of a user to discover any relevant language resource is dependent
            on the quality of the metadata that describes it. Ensuring quality through peer review is a core value that
            OLAC employs to achieve its vision. "OLAC also conducts automated review based on peer consensus regarding
            best practice" (see core value statements in [<a href="#OLAC-Process">OLAC-Process</a>]). </p>
<p>This note explains the automated system that is implemented on the OLAC web site for evaluating the quality
            of metadata records. The peer consensus regarding best practice is expressed in [<a href="#OLAC-BPR">OLAC-BPR</a>] and
            further elucidated in [<a href="#OLAC-Usage">OLAC-Usage</a>]. </p>
<h2><A name="The quality score"></A>2. The quality score</h2>
<p>Many of the best practice recommendations for resource description cannot be automatically checked for
            conformance; however, there are many that can be. As an aid in creating descriptive metadata that meets the
            latter set of recommendations, an automated quality score has been implemented. Each metadata record
            receives a score in the range of 0 to 10 based on the presence or absence of recommended practices. In some
            contexts the score is reported as a number in this range; in others it is summarized graphically as a rating
            of 1 to 5 stars. That is, any score above 9 is reported as 5 stars, scores in the range of 7 to 9 are
            reported as 4 stars, and so on.</p>
<p>The practices in focus are ones that contribute to resource discovery. The score has two major parts: 50% is
            based on the metadata elements that are present and 50% is based on the use of encoding schemes. The
            elements provide the breadth and depth of the description, while the encoding schemes provide precision for
            searching. </p>
<p>The element part of the score consists of 4 points awarded for each of four basic metadata elements that
            must be present to give the record minimal breadth of coverage, plus a further point awarded for additional
            elements that add to the depth of description. These components of the score are awarded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>Title</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of a non-empty Tittle element. Absence of a title that is
                  inherent to the resource does not block achieving this point, since in that case it is recommended
                  best practice for the cataloger to supply a descriptive title enclosed in square brackets. </p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Date</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty Date element (or any of its
                  refinements). Absence of a date in the resource itself does not block achieving this point, since in
                  that case it is recommended best practice for the cataloger to estimate the date.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Agent (Contributor, Creator, or Publisher)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty element that provides an indication of
                  who is behind the resource, whether as Contributor or Creator or Publisher.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>About (Subject, Description, or Coverage)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty element that provides an indication of
                  what the resource is about, whether Subject or Description or Coverage (or any refinement of the
                  latter two). A Subject element that uses an ISO 639-3 code is counted below under "Subject Language"
                  and does not count toward this point.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Depth</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One-fifth point (up to a maximum of one point) is awarded for each element that is present in addition
                  to the ones counted above and the ones that hold the four mandatory encoding schemes mentioned below.
                  That is, the number of additional elements is the total number of element instances in the record
                  minus the number of points (up to 8) awarded in all other components of the score excluding the point
                  for "Precision". Thus, this part of the score is whichever is less of 1 or the number of additional
                  elements divided by 5. Note that in order to get the full score of 10 points, the record must have at
                  least 13 elements. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>The encoding scheme part of the score consists of 4 points awarded for each of four basic element plus
            encoding scheme pairs that must be present to support high recall and precision in searches for language
            resources. A further point is awarded for additional use of encoding schemes that add to the precision of
            resource description. These components of the score are awarded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>Content Language</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Language element that uses the
                  [<a href="#ISO639-3">ISO639-3</a>] encoding scheme to precisely identify the language of content of the resource.
                  Absence of any natural language content in a resource (such as in a software tool) does not block
                  achieving this point, since in that case it is recommended best practice is to use the ISO 639-3 code
                     <tt>[zxx]</tt> meaning "No linguistic content." </p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Linguistic Type</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Type element that uses the
                     [<a href="#OLAC-Linguistic-Type">OLAC-Linguistic-Type</a>] encoding scheme to precisely identify the type of the resource from
                  a linguistic point of view. Such a metadata element is relevant to all OLAC records since the
                  vocabulary includes a "not_applicable" value for items that are not an instance of one of the
                  linguistic data types.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Subject Language</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for appropriate use of the [<a href="#ISO639-3">ISO639-3</a>] encoding scheme with the Subject
                  element to precisely identify the language that the resource is about. The notion of subject language
                  is not relevant to every language resource. When the linguistic type of a resource is "primary_text"
                  or "not_applicable" it is not required to have a subject language, and this point is awarded
                  automatically. Otherwise, there must be at least one Subject element using the [<a href="#ISO639-3">ISO639-3</a>]
                  encoding scheme in order to earn the point. </p>
</dd>
<dt><b>DCMI Type</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Type element that uses the [<a href="#DCMI-Type">DCMI-Type</a>]
                  encoding scheme to identify the generic type of the resource. The vocabulary is designed to be
                  applicable to any resource and this is considered mandatory for OLAC metadata in order to support
                  reliable search for resources by type (such as audio recordings versus video recordings versus
                  software).</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Precision</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>One-third point (up to a maximum of one point) is awarded for each additional encoding scheme that is
                  used in the metadata record. Thus in order to earn full points, a record must use at least three
                  encoding schemes in addition to ISO639-3, OLAC-Linguistic-Type, and DCMI-Type. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>The free-standing metadata service [<a href="#OLAC-Free">OLAC-Free</a>] can be used to see what quality score will be
            awarded to a given OLAC metadata record. The XML encoding of a record is pasted into a submission form; the
            service then validates the record. If it is valid, a report of the quality score is generated with comments
            on what must be done to raise the score to 10. The same quality analysis is shown for a sample record from
            each participating archive by following the "Sample Record" link on the [<a href="#OLAC-Archives">OLAC-Archives</a>] page. </p>
<p>The average quality score for all the records provided by a given participating archive can be seen by
            following the "Metrics" link on the [<a href="#OLAC-Archives">OLAC-Archives</a>] page. The metrics report also shows the
            breakdown across the collection of all the components that go into the quality score.</p>
<h2><A name="Other metrics"></A>3. Other metrics</h2>
<p>Could explain other metrics here.</p>
<p>And if we introduce deductions for citations issued by peer reviewers, that would need to be explained as a
            deduction to the average quality score -- e.g. one point per citation.</p>
