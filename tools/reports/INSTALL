INSTALLATION
----------------

  1. Set up the OLAC harvester (available from olac.sf.net) to store data in 
	a MySQL database.

  2. Change the value of $dbName on line 7 of .reports/lib/olacdb.php to name 
	of the OLAC database. 
	
     Change $username, $password and $hostname on lines 9 to 11 of 
	./reports/lib/olacdb.php to the appropriate values for connecting to 
	the OLAC database.

     Change $URLBASE in ./reports/reportInclude.php on line 2 to the base URL of
	the directory where the files in reports/ are stored. 

  3. Create ranking tables:

	To create the soundex and ranking tables:
	mysql> source lib/searchTables.sql

		[ Creates the tables:
			TAG_USAGE
			ITEM_SCORES
		]

  4. Populate ranking tables:

	Run the following scripts found in lib:
	?> php createTagUsageTable.php
	?> php createItemScoresTable.php
			[ depends on metadataScoring.php ]

	These scripts can be set to run at the time of harvesting to update
	the database tables.

  5. If moving the lib directory, change the value of LIB in 
	reports/reportsInclude.php to the new
	path of the lib directory. (To use archiveReportCard.php, reports
	will need to be generated again after moving the lib directory as in
	step 7). 
	
	Similarly, to move the 'style' directory, change $STYLE
	in reports/reportsInclude.php.
  
  6. Generate archive report cards

	Firstly ensure that the reports/reportCards/ directory is set to 
	the correct permissions (eg, chmod 755 reportCards)

	?> cd reports
	?> php generateReport.php

	This will create archive report cards in the directory 
	reports/reportCards/ of the form archive{$id}.html

	This script can also be set to run at the time of harvesting to update
	archive report cards.

	Archive Report Cards are then viewed using archiveReportCard.php.
