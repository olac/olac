SETUP

1. Install eXist from http://exist-db.org/download.html.  I installed eXist-setup-1.2.6-rev9165.exe on my Vista machine.

2. Configure <oXygen/> XML Editor to work with eXist. Follow instructions on the following page to create the data source:

   http://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-oxygen/native-xml-database-support.html

Then follow these instructions to create a connection using that data source:

   http://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-oxygen/configure-exist-connection.html

I replaced "<host>" with "localhost" in the URI, and used "admin" as the user.

LOADING DATA

1. Start the application by double-clicking the "eXist Database Startup" icon on the desktop.

2. Go to the home page of the eXist application:

   http://localhost:8080/exist/

3. Launch the "Webstart Client" for the administration tool; last thing in left-side navigation pane.

4. Use the third toolbar button to create a new collection (e.g. olac) and the fourth to store a new document into it (e.g. an OLAC static respository).
