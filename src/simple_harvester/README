Executing zip bundles
=====================

The zip bundles in this directory can be executed by Python without being
unpacked. For example,

    python rosetta_harvester.zip                         # Python 2.6 or higher

    PYTHONPATH=rosetta_harvester.zip python -m __main__  # Python 2.5

It is still possible to unpack to run the program. In this case, the main is
__main__.py.


Stylesheets requiring XSLT 2.0
==============================

XSL stylesheets in this directory might require XSLT 2.0. If you can't find
an XSLT processor that supports XSLT 2.0, you can use SAXON [1] home edition.
For example,

  java  -jar saxon9he.jar -xsl:rosetta_repository.xsl rosetta.xml
