Executing zip bundles
=====================

The zip bundles in this directory can be executed by Python without being
unpacked. For example,

    python rosetta_harvester.zip                         # Python 2.6 or higher

    PYTHONPATH=rosetta_harvester.zip python -m __main__  # Python 2.5

It is still possible to unpack to run the program. In this case, the main is
__main__.py.
