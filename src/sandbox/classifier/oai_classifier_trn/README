Files contained in this package
===============================

olacdb.tab
----------

A table of OLAC metadata directly from the OLAC database. An OLAC archive
consits of archive items, and an archive item in turn consists of metadata
elements. A "record" usually mean an archive item. The metadata elements
contained in the record collectively describe the resource.

oaidb.tab
---------

This table has the same format as olacdb.tab, but some fields are just empty,
i.e. the Type and Code fields are empty, since OAI archives don't provide such
information. This table contains metadata elements from archives that
supposedly have nothing to do with linguistic resources. The oai_selected.tab
file lists the archives from which the content of this table comes.

oai_selected.tab
----------------

A list of OAI archives whose metadata constitute the oaidb.tab file.

oai_catalog.tab
---------------

A list of all OAI archives contained in our database.
