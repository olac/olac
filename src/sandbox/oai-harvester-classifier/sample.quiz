3595	NO	0.99		Parent and Teacher Report: Comparing Results from the Sensory Profile and the Sensory Profile School Companion	Dunn, Winnie *** Grobe, Katherine *** Gajewski, Byron *** Clark, Jessica Saiter *** OBJECTIVE. This study investigated the similarities and differences between parent and teacher report on the Sensory Profile and the Sensory Profile School Companion (School Companion). METHOD. Using data gathered during the standardization of the School Companion, scores of 173 children with and without disabilities were analyzed. Results were based on the entire sample and subgroups organized by child, parent, and teacher demographics. RESULTS. Analyses of the entire sample demonstrate that parents and teachers have many significant similarities (16/18) and few significant differences (2/18). Scoring relationships between reporters for subgroups followed the pattern found in the literature for other parent/teacher questionnaires. CONCLUSION. Parents and teachers provided a combination of similar and unique information when evaluating a child using the Sensory Profile and the School Companion thus adding to their construct validity. Therefore, best practice indicates that evaluators should interpret results from both versions when evaluating children with these tools. *** University of Kansas *** Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy *** Education, Special *** multi-informant questionnaires *** pediatric occupational therapy *** sensory processing evaluations *** Parent and Teacher Report: Comparing Results from the Sensory Profile and the Sensory Profile School Companion

159	YES	0.96		NULL-EXPLETIVE SUBJECT IN JAPANESE	Terada, Michiko *** In the current Government and Binding framework, every sentence must have a subject. When the matrix subject position is non-thematic, it is filled by an expletive. Japanese, however, lacks an overt expletive. This raises the question of whether the language has an expletive which is null, or raises an embedded subject to the matrix subject position. I will argue that Japanese does indeed have a null-expletive by discussing how a negative polarity item behaves *** University of Kansas.

The process of collecting data may be viewed as mapping from the object space to an image space. Since most GPRs use broad beamwidth antennas, the energy reflected from a buried structure is recorded over a large lateral aperture in the image space. Migration algorithms are used to reconstruct an accurate scattering map by refocusing the recorded scattering events to their true spatial locations through a backpropagation process. The goal of this paper is to present a pair of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) reverse-time migration algorithms for CPR data processing. Linear inverse scattering theory is used to develop a matched-filter response for the GPR problem. The reverse-time migration algorithms, developed for both bistatic and monostatic antenna configurations, are implemented via FDTD in the object space. Several examples are presented. *** IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC *** Engineering, Electrical & Electronic *** synthetic aperture radar (SAR) *** Geochemistry & Geophysics *** Remote Sensing *** finite-difference time domain (FDTD) *** ground penetrating radar (GPR) *** matched filter *** reverse time migration *** A matched-filter-based reverse-time migration algorithm for ground-penetrating radar data

The motivation behind the study was characterization of CO2 pilot area in the Hall Gurney Field, Lansing Kansas City Formation. The main tool of the study was geostatistics, since only geostatistics can incorporate data from variety of sources to estimate reservoir properties. Three different subjects in geostatistical methods were studied, analyzed and improved. The first part investigates the accuracy of different geostatistical methods as a function of the available sample data. The effect of number and type of samples on conventional and stochastical methods was studied using a synthetic reservoir. The second part of the research focuses on developing a systematic geostatistical method to characterize a reservoir in the case of very limited sample data. The objective in this part was the use of dynamic data, such as data from pressure transient analysis, in geostatistical methods. In the literature review of this part emphasis is given to those works involving the incorporation of well-test data and the use of simulated annealing to incorporate different type of static and dynamic data. The second part outlines a systematic procedure to estimate the reservoir properties for a CO2 pilot area in the Lansing Kansas City formation. The third part of the thesis discusses the multiple-point geostatistics and presents an improvement in reservoir characterization using training image construction. Similarity distance function is used to find the most consistent and similar pattern for to the existing data. This part of thesis presents a mathematical improvement to the existing similarity functions. *** University of Kansas *** Engineering, Petroleum *** Geostatistics *** Hall-Gurney Field *** Reservoir Characterization *** Reservoir Characterization with Limited Sample Data using Geostatistics

4601625	YES	0.99		Expressing Ingressivity in Slavic: The Contextually-Conditioned Imperfective Past vs. the Phase Verb stat' and Procedural za-	Dickey, Stephen M. *** This article discusses different modes of expressing ingressivity in the Slavic languages  the grammatical expression of ingressivity (by means of imperfective verb forms) and its lexical expression (by means of the use of stat' as an ingressive phase verb or perfective procedural verbs prefixed with za-)  and relates them to one another as two competing systems. It is shown that these phenomena are in complementary distribution: languages that imploy the contextually-conditioned imperfective past to a high degree only imploy stat' and za- to express ingressivity to a very low degree or not at all, and vice-versa. More specifically, the contextually-conditioned imperfective past is characteristic of the extreme western end of Slavic (Czech, Slovak, Sorbian, Slovene), whereas stat' and za- are characteristic of an eastern group of languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Belorusion, Bulgarian); two languages (Polish and Serbo-Croatian occupy a transitional position between the two groups. Finally, the respective modes of expressing ingressivity are discussed within the theory of Slavic aspect developed in Dickey 1997. *** Slavica Publishers *** Slavic languages *** Verbal aspect *** Ingressivity *** Expressing Ingressivity in Slavic: The Contextually-Conditioned Imperfective Past vs. the Phase Verb stat' and Procedural za-

The review explored outcome studies for in-patient programs for adolescents with substance abuse issues in order to identify best practices for this population. The author utilized adult success rates (28% abstinence on post treatment measures) to establish a benchmark for including citations of the articles found in the extensive review. The empirically based studies conveyed support for intense and structured milieu-based interventions (individual therapy, family therapy, group therapy, utilization of the AA/NA model, and aftercare services). Trained clinicians provide the interventions maintaining a recovery-focused milieu that encourages healthy relationships and provides clear structure. The studies also noted educational and vocational components included in the treatment. The average lengths of stay that were at least 6 weeks yielded the best results. Recommendations include the demonstration and evaluation of treatment programs designed specifically to meet the needs of adolescents. *** c. 2001 State of Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services May be reproduced in original form *** University of Kansas.

Mnogi problemi, ki so e danes v ospredju jezikoslovnega raziskovanja, so pritegovali pozornost avtorjev e v ?asu antike. Tako e Aristotel in Dionizij Traki razpravljata o derivaciji in ?lanstvu v prirednih strukturah. V tem stoletju najdemo podobno razpravljanje v delih Bloomfielda in Chomskega.  Identificirati je mogo?e nekaj vrst priredja. Vezalno priredje, ki izraa pomen 'in' s priredjem (dostavljanje tipa A B), sestavljanjem (spojitev tipa A B) in vezanjem (besedno povezovanje z veznikom tipa A in B), je glavna tema ?lanka.Priredje in vezanje sta najpogosteja mehanizma prirednosti v slovanskih jezikih. Po van Oirsouwu je vezanje mogo?e deliti na zaporedno, identi?no, hkratno in naklju?no. Vse tiri vrste seuporabljajo v slovanskih jezikih z ve?jo ali manjo stopnjo besedne razli?nosti.  Dvoumnost v teh vezalnih prirednih strukturah je funkcionalna,odnosna ali hierarhi?na. Nekateri avtorji so pokazali besednorazdvoumljenje teh dvoumnosti za klasi?ne jezike, npr. staroperzij?ino, latin?ino, gr?ino in sanskrt. ?eprav se domneva, da dananji indoevropski jeziki takih struktur besedno nerazdvoumljajo ve?, nekateri slovanski jeziki vendarle lahko besedno razlikujejo ?lanstvo na viji in niji ravni v prirednih strukturah.  Sloven?ina je v tem pogledu posebno bogata, saj ima tri vezalne veznike: ter, in, pa. Ti izraajo ?lanstvo vprirednih strukturah od strukturno najvijega do najnijega, ?eprav vnjihovi rabi obstajajo stilisti?ne omejitve. Drugi slovanski jeziki sov zmonosti, da bi besedno razdvoumili priredne strukture, bolj omejeni.  Sloven?ina in nekateri drugi slovanski jeziki imajo za izraanje prirednosti na e niji ravni dodatni mehanizem s predlogom z(s), npr. midva s Petrom. Vendar v razli?nih slovanskih jezikih opazimo variacije v slovni?nosti in tevilu udeleencev v teh strukturah. Zlasti sloven?ina je v rabi priredja s predlogom z(s) bolj omejena kot ru?ina.  ENGLISH:  The nature of coordination is a current topic of debate in linguistic research. Many of the issues being discussed today, including derivation and constituency in coordinate structures, were debated by earlier writers, such as Aristotle and Dionysius Thrax, and have been paralleled in this century by linguists such as Bloomfield and Chomsky.  A number of coordination types are recognized. Copulativecoordination, expressing and' is achieved through parataxis (juxtaposition of the type A B), composition (fusion of the type A B) and conjunction (lexical linkage of the type A and B), is the focus of this article. Parataxis and conjunction arethe most frequently employed coordinate mechanisms in the Slavic languages. This latter can be subdivided, à la van Oirsouw, intoordered, identity, concomitant and coincidental conjunction. All four types occur in Slavic with varying degrees of lexical distinction.  Ambiguity in these copula coordinate structures is functional, relational or hierarchical. Lexical disambiguation of these ambiguities has been demonstrated or posited for classical languages such as Old Persian, Latin, Greek and Sanskrit. Although it has been assumed that the modern Indo-European languages no longer lexically disambiguate such constructions, some Slavic languages are able lexically to differentiate higher- and lower-level constituency within coordinate structures.  Slovene is particularly capable in this regard, employing three copulative conjunctions: ter, in and pa. These express structurally highest to lowest constituency in coordinate structures,although there are stylistic limitations on their use. Other Slavic languages are more limited in their ability lexically to disambiguate coordinate structures.  A further coordination mechanism, expressed with the prepositionz (s) (e.g., midva s Petrom), can express yet alower level of coordination in Slovene and some other Slavic languages.However, there is cross-linguistic variation in the grammaticality and number of participants of these constructions. In particular, Slovene is more limited than Russian in its use of coordination with the preposition z (s). *** ZRC SAZU / Hall Center for the Humanities *** Slovene language *** Slovenian language *** syntax *** copula *** coordination *** Slavic languages *** grammar *** Indo-European *** conjunctions *** Slavic languages *** Hierarchical Ambiguities in Copula Coordinate Structures in Slovene and Other Slavic Languages

The resulting protocols actively engage the brain through the use of rhythmic entrainment and can have positive outcomes when actively treating issues related to motor, speech/language, and cognition. This paper will show the connection that the structural properties of music can create in a therapeutic environment. The historical perspective of the joining of music and cognition will be briefly discussed, followed by a description of the physiological effect of music on the body. An explanation of techniques and protocols showing how the structural properties of music actively engage the brain is discussed, in addition to specific behavioral techniques utilized for behavior modification. *** University of Kansas *** Music *** music *** neural music protocols *** special needs children *** Music - A Gateway to Reaching Developmental Processes of Children with Special Needs

I develop these themes in the following ways. First, utilizing a temporal lens from social theory, I briefly typologize the theoretical canon. Second, I employ a genealogical history to uncover the coeval rises of Western standard time and territorial state sovereignty. Third, I argue that the dominance of abstract, Western temporality continues virtually unchallenged, implicating IR scholarship in the reproduction of that hegemony. Finally, I address theoretical developments that have the potential to contribute to a greater understanding of time's role in international relations by showing how time is productive of the social subject. *** University of Kansas *** Political Science, International Law and Relations *** Political Science, General *** Sociology, Theory and Methods *** time *** temporality *** International Relations theory *** Western standard time *** Time and International Relations Theory

922	YES	0.99		Testing the Role of Phonetic Naturalness in Mandarin Tone Sandhi	Zhang, Jie *** Lai, Yuwen *** 33 Yuwen Lai The University of Kansas yuwen@ku.edu It has long been noted that phonological patterning is influenced by phonetic factors. But phonologists diverge on whether phonetic motivations take effect in synchronic or diachronic phonology. This article aims to tease apart the two theories by investigating native Mandarin speakers applications of two tone sandhi processes to novel words: the phonetically motivated contour reduction 213 21/__T (T 213) and the neutralizing 213 35/__213 whose phonetic motivations are less clear. Twenty Mandarin subjects were asked to produce two monosyllables they heard as disyllabic words. Five groups of disyllabic words were tested: AO-AO (AO=actual occurring morpheme) where the disyllable is also a real word, AO-AO where the disyllable is nonoccurring, AO-AG (AG=accidental gap in Mandarin lexicon  legal syllable and tone but non-existent combination), AG-AO, and AG-AG. The first syllable is always 213, and the second syllable has one of the four tones in Mandarin. Results show that speakers apply the phonetically more natural 213 21 sandhi more quickly and with greater accuracy than the 213 35 sandhi. Theoretically, the study supports the direct relevance of phonetics to synchronic phonology by showing that there is a psychological advantage to phonetically natural patterns. Methodologically, it complements existing research paradigms that test the nature of the phonology-phonetics relationship, e.g., the study of phonological acquisition and the artificial language paradigm; when extended to other Chinese dialects, it can also provide insights into the long-standing mystery of how Chinese speakers internalise complicated tone sandhi patterns that sometimes involve opacity, near-neutralization, and syntactic dependency. *** University of Kansas.

From these data we extract the ratio of isospin amplitudes \\A2/A0\\, and the cosine of the relative phase delta = delta2 - delta0 between these amplitudes, for D --> pipi decays. Unlike the situation in kaon decay where A2 is strongly suppressed, we find \\A2/A0\\ = 0.72 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.11 and cos delta = 0.14 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.09. *** AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOC *** MEASUREMENT OF THE D-]PI-PI BRANCHING FRACTIONS

Theoretical results predict that the wavelength of peak FWM efficiency shifts away from the fiber zero-dispersion wavelength and indicate that the conventional phase-matching factor may induce significant errors in FWM calculations.

One of the central diagnostic symptoms of depression is sleep disturbance. Accordingly, this study was designed to examine the effects of omega-3 fatty acid on self-reported insomnia. It was hypothesized that participants assigned to supplement their diet with omega-3 fatty acid would have improvements in sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, sleep fragmentation and actual sleep time. Supplementary hypotheses examined were that omega-3 fatty acid might improve cognitive ability and sub-syndromal depressive symptoms. Participants were 27 undergraduate students reporting a variety of sleep difficulties as assessed by self report of insomnia symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned either to a treatment condition, with a daily supplement of 1500 mg omega-3 fatty acid and 30 IU of vitamin E, or a control group that received 30 IU daily of vitamin E. Sleep was monitored over a 28 day period, the last 21 days of which participants were instructed to take the assigned supplements. Participants were measured on objective (Actigraph) and subjective self-report measures of sleep for seven days prior to the intervention, and during the last seven days of the intervention. They also completed a self-report screen for depressive symptoms and several cognitive tasks immediately prior to and following the intervention. A 2x2 mixed factoral analysis of variance was performed on all outcome variables. The treatment group did not improve significantly more than the control group on any measures of sleep, or mood. One cognitive measure of processing speed did significantly improve for the treatment condition. These findings are discussed in light of study limitations and the existing literature, and recommendations made for additional research focused on the possibility of sleep improvements with omega-3 supplementation in a clinically depressed population. *** University of Kansas *** Psychology, Clinical *** actigraphy *** insomnia *** omega-3 fatty acid *** sleep *** OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID SUPPLEMENTATION AND SLEEP

Three selection schemes are studied: synergistic, antagonistic, and multiplicative interactions among sites. Their respective effects on the level of nucleotide diversity, the pattern of linkage disequilibrium, and the allele frequency spectrum are determined. Surprisingly, none of these aspects are affected by directional epistasis when the overall strength of selection is held constant (where the equilibrium allele frequencies are equal). The equilibrium mean fitness does differ with selection regime, and is relatively higher with synergistic interactions while lower with antagonistic epistasis. These findings legitimate the application of many population genetic models assuming multiplicative selection when there are actually epistatic interactions among sites, and have important implications on the evolution of recombination. *** University of Kansas *** Biology, Genetics *** Agriculture, General *** Biology, Molecular *** codon bias *** epistasis *** linkage disequilibrium *** mean fitness *** molecular evolution *** nucleotide diversity *** Effects of directional epistasis on molecular evolution

Zaradi geografske lo?enosti od Slovenije, e zlasti pa zaradi izredno mo?nega vpliva pragmati?no dominantnega anglekega jezika, doivlja sloven?ina v tem okolju zelo specifi?en razvoj.   Analizira podatke, zbrane v empiri?ni raziskavi (posnetke intervjujev z informanti), da bi ugotovila morebitne spremembe, ki so nastale v jeziku kot posledica stika z angle?ino. Te sre?amo v vseh zvrsteh dvojezi?nega diskurza (sposojanje, kodno preklapljanje, enojezi?ni slovenski deli diskurza) in na razli?nih jezikovnih ravninah od glasoslovja do pomenoslovja in pragmatike. Najizraziteje se angleki vpliv kae v oblikoslovju, kjer prihaja do poenostavljanja, posploevanja in opu?anja slovenskih sklanjatvenih vzorcev, in v skladnji, kjer postaja besedni vrstni red vedno bolj podoben anglekemu.

ENGLISH: The article discusses the linguistic situation among immigrants of Slovene descent in the United States of America and Canada. Owing to the geographic distance between Slovenia and the host country and particularly to the very strong influence of the pragmatically dominant English, Slovene there is undergoing a very specific kind of development.   Data collected through empirical research (interview excerpts) are analyzed in order to identify contact-motivated changes of Slovene. These are encountered in all types of bilingual discourse (borrowing, code switching, English-influenced monolingual Slovene) and on different linguistic levels from phonology to semantics and pragmatics. The most salient areas of English linguistic impact, however, are morphology with its simplification, regularization and/or even deletion of Slovene inflectional system, and syntax with its gradual adoption of English-like SVO word order patterns.   On a sentence level these kinds of structures constitute what could be termed a composite matrix language, made up from the features of both languages. Development, though, stops short of the so-called matrix language turnover (MLT), because it is interrupted by a very rapid process of language shift from Slovene to English. This has been accomplished in the course of three generations in the case of pre-war immigrants and even faster in the case of post-war ones. The variety of Slovene in this particular context is therefore of a very temporary and unstable nature and defies the postulation of rigid structural constraints on it. It nevertheless represents a distinct contact variety of Slovene well worth further research because of the likely insights into the language change mechanisms that it may provide. *** Slovene language *** English language *** language contact *** diaspora languages *** sociolinguistics *** code-switching *** Language Change in a Contact Situation: The Case of Slovene in North America

There is a growing concern about security risks inherent with a wireless data network, such as loss of confidentiality, loss of integrity and loss of network availability (Karygiannis & Owens, 2002).  According to a number of studies, the traditional wireless security services, based on the IEEE 802.11 standard as known as Wired Equivalent Protection (WEP) and commonly used in universitys wireless data networks, are hopelessly flawed and have failed to provide a robust security system to a wireless network (Sankar, Sandaralingam, Miller, & Balinsky, 2004). Designing a wireless security service for a university environment requires more comprehensive understanding than that for a public place, home, organization, or governmental office.  The wireless data network of a university has to be very flexible so that it can support a variety of user behaviors from a number of different types of wireless terminals like in an open public place.  In addition, the wireless data network must be capable of efficiently authenticating a user to an access point (AP) and vice versa, and to ensure that the users information and data being propagated in the air are secure.  Thus, deploying a wireless network security based on the Wireless Protected Access (WPA) specification with Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology should be the most appropriate solution to effectively securing a universitys wireless data network. With the WPA and VPN security solutions, a university information services (IS) department will be able to satisfy the user needs by providing a strong wireless security to its users and supporting all types of wireless devices.  In addition, the university IS department can increase its wireless data network performance by utilizing existing network elements, such as wireless APs and VPN equipment, and improving its network services, operation and management.  And at the very least, while providing sufficient security based on WPA and VPN security solutions to its users, the university IS department can lower the network installation costs and thoroughly work on a smooth transition to the wireless security service based on the IEEE 802.11i standard, which is expected to be widely implemented in the future (Perez, 2004). *** Protecting a University's Wireless Data Network with the WPA and VPN Security Solutions

UNC-115, a putative actin-binding protein similar to human abLIM/limatin, has previously been implicated in axon pathfinding. We have discovered the role of UNC-115 as a downstream cytoskeletal effector of Rac signaling in axon pathfinding. We show that unc-115 double mutants with ced-10 Rac, mig-2 Rac or unc-73 GEF but not with rac-2/3 Rac displayed synthetic axon pathfinding defects, and that loss of unc-115 function suppressed the formation of ectopic plasma membrane extensions induced by constitutively-active rac-2 in neurons. Furthermore, we show that UNC-115 can bind to actin filaments. Thus, UNC-115 is an actin-binding protein that acts downstream of Rac signaling in axon pathfinding. *** COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD *** Rac *** UNC-115 *** actin-binding protein *** axon pathfinding *** The actin-binding protein UNC-115 is an effector of Rac signaling during axon pathfinding in C-elegans

It is shown that these phenomena are in complementary distribution: languages that imploy the contextually-conditioned imperfective past to a high degree only imploy stat' and za- to express ingressivity to a very low degree or not at all, and vice-versa. More specifically, the contextually-conditioned imperfective past is characteristic of the extreme western end of Slavic (Czech, Slovak, Sorbian, Slovene), whereas stat' and za- are characteristic of an eastern group of languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Belorusion, Bulgarian); two languages (Polish and Serbo-Croatian occupy a transitional position between the two groups.

For many RECWEB, half of the calendar year is comprised of holidays and seasons. Spikes in website traffic and transactions can lower availability, modifiability, and performance of a RECWEB. This can result in downtime, customer abandonment, and ultimately lost revenue. This research focuses the modifiability aspects of the problem. During holiday and seasonal periods, enhancements to a RECWEB are generally not feasible. Enhancements put availability and performance at risk. In addition, most human resources are dedicated managing content changes. RECWEB are less modifiable then other systems because enhancements are only feasible for half of the calendar year. Furthermore, the scope of an enhancement must fit within a six month time box. This research provides pilot project for testing, designing, and implementing a highly modifiable RECWEB. The approach is to automate seasonal content changes. The cost savings on human resources can be reallocated to enhancements work. In addition, enhancements can simulate holiday seasons further in advance. The result is enhancement deployment is more feasible throughout the calendar year. *** University of Kansas *** Computer Science *** Education, General *** Computer Science *** software modifiablity *** software architecture *** e-commerce *** retail *** seasonal *** holiday *** DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A HIGHLY MODIFIABLE RETAIL E-COMMERCE WEBSITE

Recent progress made in the genetic and molecular analysis of epithelial polarity and cellular junctions in Drosophila has led to the most detailed understanding of these processes in a whole animal model system to date. Asymmetry of the plasma membrane and the differentiation of membrane domains and cellular junctions are controlled by protein complexes that assemble around transmembrane proteins such as DE-cadherin, Crumbs, and Neurexin IV, or other cytoplasmic protein complexes that associate with the plasma membrane. Much remains to be learned of how these complexes assemble, establish their polarized distribution, and contribute to the asymmetric organization of epithelial cells. *** Annual Review *** epithelium *** cellular junctions *** polarity *** cellularization *** membrane domain *** EPITHELIAL CELL POLARITY AND CELL JUNCTIONS IN DROSOPHILA

1177	NO	0.99		Implicit attitude measures: Consistency, stability, and convergent validity	Cunningham, W. A. *** Preacher, K. J. *** Banaji, M. R. *** In recent years, several techniques have been developed to measure implicit social cognition. Despite their increased use, little attention has been devoted to their reliability and validity. This article undertakes a direct assessment of the interitem consistency, stability, and convergent validity of some implicit attitude measures among college students. Attitudes toward blacks and whites were measured on four separate occasions, each 2 wks apart, using three relatively implicit measures (response-window evaluative priming, the Implicit Association Test, and the response-window Implicit Association Test) and one explicit measure (Modern Racism Scale). After correcting for interitem inconsistency with latent variable analyses, the authors found that (a) stability indices improved and (b) implicit measures were substantially correlated with each other, forming a single latent factor. The psychometric properties of response-latency implicit measures have greater integrity than recently suggested. *** Implicit Association Test *** implicit attitudes *** reliability *** Implicit attitude measures: Consistency, stability, and convergent validity

They include:[kena] (can), [mesda] (would like to), [vela] (want to), [darfa] (be allowed to), [sola] (ought to/must), and [mi:n] (must). These modals specify the speaker's point of view in regard to the reported event. They are able to express several levels of probability regarding the event's potential fulfillment. They form two lubcategories depending on the presence or absence of an external source of authority imposed on the agent. The deontic and epistemic meanings of Alsatian modals support Horn's (1972) hypothesis that the latter two meanings are semantically related. *** University of Kansas.

1321	NO	0.99		Kansas Refraction Profiles	Steeples, Don W. *** Miller, Richard D. *** Historically, refraction surveys have been conducted in hopes of mapping distinct layers within the earth. Refraction is a useful tool provided its limitations and the assumption that layers increase in seismic velocity with increasing depth are kept in mind. A traditional reversed-refraction profile was conducted along a 500-km (300- mi)-long east-west line extending from Concordia, Kansas, to Agate, Colorado. Analysis of the data showed an average crustal velocity of 6.1 kmlsec (3.7 milsec) and an average upper-mantle P phase velocity of 8.29 kmlsec (4.97 milsec) with a Moho depth calculated to be 36 km (23 mi) on the eastern end and 46 km (29 mi) on the western end. Some evidence suggests velocities as high as 7.2 kmlsec (4.3 milsec) in the crust at various locations along the survey line. The strong east-west regional gravity gradient of -0.275 mgalb supports the seismically drawn conclusion of a thinning of crust in north-central Kansas. In order to supplement the data from this refraction survey, we took advantage of the Kansas earthquake seismograph network. A crustal study using earthquakes as energy sources and a regional earthquake network as seismometer locations resulted in a crustal-velocity model that will improve determination of local earthquake locations. A large anomalous body in the upper mantle/lower crust, assumed to be related to the Precambrian-aged Midcontinent Geophysical Anomaly (MGA), resulted in early Pwave arrivals from refracted energy from the Moho recorded at Concordia, Salina, Tuttle Creek, and Milford. An omnidirectional positive P residual zone near El Dorado may be related to the Wichita geomagnetic low. Some evidence suggests the presence of a lower velocity material on the western and eastern flanks of the MGA, possibly representing the Rice Formation. A P velocity of 8.25 krn/secÂ±0.1k m/sec (4.95 mi/sec+0.09m i/sec) with the crust thinning from west to east and an apparent thinning from the north and from the south was determined from the 16 regional earthquakes studied. Crustal thickness from central Kansas through western Missouri seems to be relatively consistent. *** Kansas Geological Survey *** seismic reflection *** tectonics *** midcontinent *** Kansas Refraction Profiles

3686	YES	1.0		Verbal Reference as a Strategy for Text Cohesion	Burazer, Lara *** Glagolska referenca (nanaanje) kot oblika ustvarjanja kohezije  Avtorica v ?lanku najprej izpostavi razliko v pojmovanju reference v filozofskem in jezikoslovnem smislu, nato pa na primeru Hallidayjevega sistemsko-funkcijskega modela opredeli pojem glagolske reference. Ta je izraena z rabo splonopomenskih glagolov, v povezavi s kazalnimi zaimki. Ugotovitev je v ?lanku podkrepljena s slovenskimi in anglekimi zgledi, ki poudarjajo tesno povezanost splonopomenskega glagola s kazalnim zaimkom kot referen?no enoto. Pri tem se pokae tudi ugotovitev, da v sloven?ini funkcijo splonopomenskega glagola privzema niz glagolskih nadpomenk, medtem ko v angle?ini to vlogo opravlja izklju?no za-glagol do.  Na podro?ju besediloslovja se avtorji pri obravnavi reference kot kohezivnega sredstva razhajajo. Npr. de Beaugrande in Dressler referenco obravnavata v povezavi s substitucijo, saj po njunem mnenju obe sredstvi delujeta na ravni rabe za-oblik. Trdita, da je substitucija oblika reference in obratno. Tu se kot pomemben element nanaalnosti v angle?ini pokae dolo?ni ?len, v sloven?ini pa naletimo na pojav ni?tega pozaimljenja. Obe zna?ilnosti zaznamujeta temeljno razlikovanje v analiziranju glagolske reference v sloven?ini in angle?ini.  Referenca je s strani avtorjev Lo Cascia in Howelinga predstavljena tudi z vidika odnosov med glagolskimi dejanji, izraenimi z rabo slovni?nih ?asov. Glagolska dejanja sta razdelila na avtonomna in neavtonomna, pri ?emer so avtonomna dejanja deikti?na in predstavljajo odnosnico neavtonomnim dejanjem. Tu se zopet pokae razlika med sloven?ino in angle?ino. V angle?ini je to razmerje med glagolskimi dejanji izraeno z rabo razli?nih slovni?nih ?asov, v sloven?ini pa je zajeto v semanti?ni vrednosti glagolskih oblik.  V zaklju?ku avtorica poudari pomen reference kot domene glagolskih, in ne le samostalnikih prvin. Referenca v jezikoslovju predstavlja kompleksno podro?je, ki se na ravni diskurzne obravnave prepleta z obravnavo slovni?nih ?asov.  Verbal Reference as a Strategy for Text Cohesion  The author first treats the difference between reference in its philosophical and linguistic contexts, then defines the notion of verbal reference on the basis of Hallidays systemic-functional model. This is expressed with the use of general verbs in conjunction with demonstrative pronouns. The results of the research emphasize the close connection between a general verb and the demonstrative pronoun as a unit of reference, which is supported by Slovene and English examples. It is also discovered that in Slovene the function of a general verb is taken by a number of verbal meanings of higher order, whereas in English the same role is played exclusively by the pro-verb do.  In the realm of text analysis there are differing views on the treatment of reference as a means of cohesion. For example, de Beaugrande and Dressler treat reference in connection with substitution, since in their opinion both means function on the level of pro-forms. They claim that substitution is a form of reference and vice versa. Here the English definite article is important, whereas in Slovene the phenomenon of zero pronominalization is encountered.  According to Lo Cascio and Howeling, reference is presented from the point of view of the relationships between verbal actions expressed with the use of grammatical tenses. Verbal actions are divided into autonomous and non-autonomous actions, where autonomous actions are deictic and present a reference to non-autonomous actions. In English this relationship between verbal actions is expressed with the use of various grammatical tenses, whereas in Slovene it is encompassed by the semantic value of verbal forms.  In the conclusion the author emphasizes the meaning of reference as a domain of verbal and not exclusively nominal elements. Reference in linguistics represents a complex area of investigation, which on the level of discourse is closely bound up with the treatment of the use of grammatical tense. *** Intitut za slovenski jezik Frana Ramova ZRC SAZU; Hall Center for the Humanites, University of Kansas *** text linguistics *** discourse *** Slovene language *** Slovenian language *** Glagolska referenca (nanaanje) kot oblika ustvarjanja kohezije *** Verbal Reference as a Strategy for Text Cohesion
941	NO	1.0		An Evaluation of Succession Planning: Ensuring Strong and Effective Leadership for Tomorrow	Gaines, Gretchen *** There is a growing leadership gap in todays organizations. This leadership gap is preventing companies from successfully developing the leadership potential they need to remain competitive in a rapidly-changing business climate. Many experienced workers are at or nearing retirement age, the talent pool of younger professionals is much smaller and prone to higher turnover, there is less redundancy in management positions, and company loyalty is harder to inspire due to company downsizing trends and the outsourcing of services that were once a traditional part of doing business. As a result, it is becoming more and more critical that a company develops a strong and proactive succession plan for key leadership positions at all levels within the company.  One of the nations leading engineering, architectural and planning firms headquartered in the Kansas City metropolitan area needs to develop a proactive and effective approach to company succession planning in order to identify, retain, develop, and empower its future company leaders and sustain and grow its competitive advantage in the engineering industry.  The principal purpose of this paper is to identify, evaluate and ultimately recommend strategies and applications for success for implementing an effective succession plan at this engineering firm. This paper provides an introduction to succession planning through a topic overview and background; conducts a literature review to identify key trends, themes and challenges with succession planning; makes the case for why succession planning is needed at Company A; provides insight from peer interviews to identify industry best practices; and concludes with recommendations for practical leadership succession planning tools and applications for success for possible implementation at Company A. *** An Evaluation of Succession Planning: Ensuring Strong and Effective Leadership for Tomorrow

580	YES	1.0		Internacionalizmi med sloven?ino in angle?ino	Leban, Ksenija *** SLOVENE: Poglavitni cilj tudije je bil ugotoviti, ali govorci sloven?ine in angle?ine lahko uporabljajo internacionalizme, besede, ki so del mednarodnega besedi?a, kot lekseme, ki se pomensko povsem ujemajo v obeh jezikih.  V ta namen je avtorica pripravila korpus, ki zajema 895 slovenskih internacionalizmov na l- in njihovih anglekih ustreznic. Leksikalne pare je avtorica primerjala med seboj, da bi preverila, ali si izrazi ustrezajo pomensko, in sicer na konceptualni, konotacijski, kolokacijski in slogovni ravni, ter oblikovno, in sicer v morfoloki sestavi, izgovarjavi in zapisu.  Rezultati tudije so pokazali, da ima le omejeno tevilo slovensko-anglekih internacionalizmov dovolj skupnih semanti?nih, morfolokih, foneti?nih in ortografskih lastnosti, da bi jih govorci tujega jezika lahko uporabljali v skladu s pravili maternega jezika, ne da bi v drugem jeziku naredili napako.  Pri ve?ini preu?evanih leksikalnih parov je avtorica opazila razlike v pomenu, morfoloki sestavi, izgovarjavi oziroma pisavi. Pogosto so se leksikalni pari med seboj razlikovali na ve? ravneh. Pomenski lani prijatelji se lahko med seboj razlikujejo na ravni pomena, morfologije, izgovarjave in pisave. Pomenski lani prijatelji se sicer pomensko ujemajo, razlikujejo pa se v svoji morfoloki sestavi. Morfolokim razlikam se lahko pridruijo tudi razhajanja v izgovarjavi in zapisu. Glasoslovne lane prijatelje razli?no izgovarjamo, v?asih pa tudi zapisujemo, medtem ko so razlike med ortografskimi lanimi prijatelji omejene zgolj na zapis.  ?eprav so internacionalizmi del mednarodnega besedi?a, jih v sloven?ini in angle?ini ne uporabljamo na enak na?in. Navzlic temu nas navidezne podobnosti med njimi pogosto zavedejo, in sklepamo, da gre za lekseme, ki imajo enak pomen in se v jeziku podobno obnaajo, prav na podlagi taknega sklepanja pa lahko naredimo napake in se ujamemo v past lanih prijateljev.  ENGLISH: The major aim of the survey here reported was to establish whether internationalisms, words which are used internationally, may be used by Slovene and English language users as lexical items with a total meaning overlap.  For the purpose of the study, a corpus comprising 895 Slovene lexical items beginning with the letter L and their English-language counterparts was created. The lexical items in the corpus were then compared to verify their similarities in meaning, both on the conceptual, connotational, collocational and stylistic levels, and in form, both in terms of their morphological structure, pronunciation and orthography.  The study showed that only a limited number of internationalisms between Slovene and English share enough semantic, morphological, phonetic and orthographic characteristics to be used in the foreign language without falling into the trap of committing interlingual errors.  With most of the analysed lexical pairs, differences in meaning, morphological structure, pronunciation and/or spelling could be observed. Often, lexical pairs differed on more than one level. Semantic false friends, for example, may differ in meaning, morphology, pronunciation and spelling. With morphological false friends, the meanings of the lexemes are the same - the lexical pairs would differ in their morphological structure. Often, morphological differences would be accompanied by phonological and orthographical divergences as well. Finally, while with phonological false friends differences in pronunciation may be supported also by different spelling, divergences among orthographical false friends are restricted to orthography.  Although it is true that internationalisms are words which are used internationally, it has been proven that they are not used in the same way in the Slovene-English language pair. Yet, it is their apparent similarities that often lead us to believe that they share their meaning and linguistic behaviour, thus inducing us to commit interlingual errors of false-friend type. *** ZRC SAZU / Hall Center for the Humanities *** Slovene language *** Slovenian language *** Americanisms *** internationalism *** lexicography *** speech errors *** cognates *** false friends *** A Survey of Internationalisms between Slovene and English *** Internacionalizmi med sloven?ino in angle?ino

121	NO	0.99		Passive strain distribution in the interosseous ligament of the forearm: Implications for injury reconstruction	Gabriel, MT *** Pfaeffle, HJ *** Stabile, Kenneth J *** Tomaino, MM *** Fischer, Kenneth J *** Purpose: For severe forearm injuries such as an Essex-Lopresti fracture-dislocation, functional reconstruction necessitates repair of the interosseous ligament (IOL) to restore normal load sharing between the radius and ulna. Locating or tensioning such a reconstruction improperly can lead to abnormal load sharing and/or restriction of forearm rotation. The normal IOL strains should indicate the proper location of reconstruction grafts and the proper forearm rotation for tensioning the grafts. The objective of this study was to quantify the passive strain distribution of the IOL of the forearm with passive rotation of the forearm throughout the range of motion. Methods: The 3-dimensional motions of the radius with respect to the ulna were measured throughout forearm rotation in 10 cadaveric forearms by using an instrumented spatial linkage. From the bone motions and ligament insertion site geometry from dissection and computed tomographic scanning, insertion site motions were determined and used to calculate changes in ligament fiber lengths. Results: The measured strain distribution in the IOL was nonuniform and varied with forearm rotation. The overall magnitude of IOL strain was found to be greatest in supination and smallest in pronation. In supination the strains varied across fibers with strains being greatest in the distal fibers and lowest in the proximal fibers. Strains in neutral rotation were uniform across fibers. Although fibers were generally slack in pronation proximal fibers were less slack than distal fibers. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that fiber strains in the IOL vary from proximal to distal and depend on forearm rotation. Our data suggest that to prevent restriction of forearm rotation all grafts should be tensioned in supination, where measured strains were generally highest. Our data also suggest that a 2-bundle IOL reconstruction may be necessary for proper load transfer between the radius and ulna in both supination and pronation.

A study of babbling at a turning period of the child's development has shown that the French child acquires adult phonological rhythm quite early in interactive situations. There is a strict initial isochrony followed progressively towards 13 months by a final lengthening which, from 16 months on, is the same as in adult speech. This kind of rhythm is not found in solitary play. A review of the literature on English babbling indicates that things are not so clear in the acquisition of phonological rhythm in this language, as its main characteristic, which is stress, seems to be acquired quite late. *** University of Kansas.

Though Bush's use of simulated atonement allowed him to evade accountability for the Abu Ghraib and WMD scandals, his strategy failed to stem the public backlash following Hurricane Katrina. Several factors explained why simulated atonement might work for certain rhetors, and a few limitations of the strategy were explored.

1418	NO	0.99		Processing of multiple-receiver spaceborne arrays for wide-area SAR	Stiles, James Marion *** Rajakrishna, D *** Lin, SC *** Goodman, NA *** The instantaneous area illuminated by a single-aperture synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is fundamentally limited by the minimum SAR antenna area constraint. This limitation is due to the fact that the number of illuminated resolution cells cannot exceed the number of collected data samples. However, if spatial sampling is added through the use of multiple-receiver arrays, then the maximum unambiguous illumination area is increased because multiple beams can be formed to reject range-Doppler ambiguities. Furthermore, the maximum unambiguous illumination area increases with the number of receivers in the array. One spaceborne implementation of multiple-aperture SAR that has been proposed is a constellation of formation-flying satellites. In this implementation, several satellites fly in a cluster and work together as a single coherent system. There are many advantages to the constellation implementation including cost benefits, graceful performance degradation, and the possibility of performing in multiple modes. The disadvantage is that the spatial samples provided by such a constellation will be sparse and irregularly spaced; consequently, traditional matched filtering produces unsatisfactory results. We investigate SAR performance and processing of sparse, multiple-aperture arrays. Three filters are evaluated: the matched filter, maximum-likelihood filter, and minimum mean-squared error filter. It is shown that the maximum-likelihood and minimum mean-squared error filters can provide quality SAR images when operating on data obtained from sparse satellite constellations. We also investigate the performance of the three filters versus system parameters such as SNR, the number of receivers in the constellation, and satellite positioning error. *** IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC *** Remote Sensing *** synthetic aperture radar *** Geochemistry & Geophysics *** Engineering, Electrical & Electronic *** array signal processing *** multidimensional signal processing *** radar *** radar signal processing *** random arrays *** spaceborne radar *** Processing of multiple-receiver spaceborne arrays for wide-area SAR
1275	NO	0.99		Sea urchin vault structure, composition, and differential localization during development	Stewart, PL *** Makabi, M *** Lang, J *** Dickey-Sims, C *** Robertson, AJ *** Coffman, JA *** Suprenant, Kathy A *** Background: Vaults are intriguing ribonucleoprotein assemblies with an unknown function that are conserved among higher eukaryotes. The Pacific coast sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, is an invertebrate model organism that is evolutionarily closer to humans than Drosophila and C. elegans, neither of which possesses vaults. Here we compare the structures of sea urchin and mammalian vaults and analyze the subcellular distribution of vaults during sea urchin embryogenesis. Results: The sequence of the sea urchin major vault protein (MVP) was assembled from expressed sequence tags and genome traces, and the predicted protein was found to have 64% identity and 81% similarity to rat MVP. Sea urchin MVP includes seven similar to 50 residue repeats in the N-terminal half of the protein and a predicted coiled coil domain in the C-terminus, as does rat MVP. A cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) reconstruction of isolated sea urchin vaults reveals the assembly to have a barrel- shaped external structure that is nearly identical to the rat vault structure. Analysis of the molecular composition of the sea urchin vault indicates that it contains components that may be homologs of the mammalian vault RNA component ( vRNA) and protein components (VPARP and TEP1). The sea urchin vault appears to have additional protein components in the molecular weight range of 14-55 kDa that might correspond to molecular contents. Confocal experiments indicate a dramatic relocalization of MVP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during sea urchin embryogenesis. Conclusions: These results are suggestive of a role for the vault in delivering macromolecules to the nucleus during development. *** BIOMED CENTRAL LTD *** Sea urchin vault structure, composition, and differential localization during development
