2894	NO	1.0		Karpowitz, Dennis *** Rhode, Paula C. *** Higgins, Raymond *** Kirk, Sarah *** Frey, Bruce *** Hockemeyer, Jill Renee *** The consequences of the current obesity epidemic are taking a serious toll on the health and the economics of our society. The prevention and treatment of obesity remain a challenge for researchers and society. Over the past 15-20 years behavioral treatments have been developed which have been successful in helping people lose weight, but individuals struggle to maintain this weight loss. Several studies provide evidence that emotional and psychological factors may play an important role in weight loss and maintenance. However, most behavioral treatment approaches do not adequately address the role of emotional factors. Interventions specifically designed to help individuals who are overweight or obese better cope with emotional distress may attenuate the negative effects of distress on weight loss and maintenance through improved emotional self-regulatory processes. This study examined the effects of expressive writing on weight regain, stress, and emotional eating among individuals who have recently lost weight. Men and women (N = 64) who recently lost weight were recruited and randomized to either an emotional expressive (n = 31) or to a placebo control writing intervention (n = 33). Baseline assessments were completed followed by writing sessions that took place once weekly across four consecutive weeks. Follow-up assessments of weight, stress and emotional eating were completed at the end of the final writing session, and again at 1 and 3 months. Results from this study indicated that there was no support for expressive writing to impact the rate of weight regain among individuals who have recently lost weight. However, there was partial support for expressive writing to decrease stress levels. No support was found, however, for expressive writing to decrease emotional eating. The results from this study provide poor support for the beneficial effects of written emotional disclosure on buffering weight regain and decreasing emotional eating following weight loss treatment. There is, however, minimal evidence that expressive writing may produce favorable effects on stress levels in individuals who are attempting to maintain weight loss. Implications of these findings and ideas for future research to improve weight loss and maintenance outcomes are discussed. *** University of Kansas *** Psychology, Clinical *** Written emotional expression: Effects on weight loss and maintenance

Results indicated that Japanese college students were most exposed to sexually explicit material in the print media followed by the Internet and the electronic media. In addition, participants' exposure to sexually explicit Internet material (SEIM) was a stronger predictor of their sexually permissive attitudes than their exposures to sexually explicit material in the traditional media (i.e., print and electronic media) However, participants' exposures to sexually explicit material in the traditional media were stronger predictors of Japanese college students' perceptions of women than their exposure to SEIM. Furthermore, sexual interest mediated the relationship between exposure to sexually explicit material on the internet and perceptions of women. Results are discussed in light of cultivation theory, the uses and gratifications perspective, and prior literature in the use of sexually explicit material and its associations with sexually permissive attitudes and perceptions of women. *** University of Kansas *** Mass Communications *** College students *** Internet *** Japanese *** media *** Sexual attitudes *** Sexually explicit material *** Japanese College Students' Exposure to Sexually Explicit Internet Material (SEIM) and Sexual Attitudes

Listeners were separated into a word training (N=14), sentence training (N=13) or control group (N=14). Depending on the training, targets were presented by Spanish-accented speakers as single word tokens or combined to form semantically anomalous sentences. Results showed that listeners who heard sentence-only information were best able to utilize their training. The employment of several strategies including the utilization of prosodic elements available in the spoken sentences and an exposure to a wider range of phonetic environments likely led to the improvement. The results suggest that for native listeners and non-native speakers, a high variability paradigm can be employed successfully when paired with sentence level information as all benefits found with word-only training were met or exceeded by sentence-only training. *** University of Kansas *** Language, Linguistics *** High-Vairiability *** Training *** Improving the Perception of Foreign-Accented Speech through Training: A Comparison of Word and Sentence Materials

3915	NO	0.99		Luhman, Reid A. *** One of the major problems in the sociology of occupations has been a tendency to accept concepts stemming from occupations themselves rather than from the development of a body of concepts logically separated from those ideological considerations. Occupational division of labor is accepted as a "given" in the course of much analysis with little attempt made to either explain the genesis of such a development or its subsequent interrelations with other elements of social systems. Much of this problem can be alleviated through an emphasis on process models which make conceptual distincti,ons between social and non-social factors affecting occupations. Occupations (or divided human work) form an elaborate system which ultimately derives from man's relation to his environment. Men are confronted by objective problems of survival with which they must deal. Such dealings contain a knowledge-technology factor in an objective sense (i.e., distinct from social meaning which may be imputed to that knowledge and technology). The division and allocation of knowledge and technology among occupations is the s ocLaL factor - the factor which in this model is labeled ideology. Ideology, the division and allocation of knowledge and technology in a society, then interacts with the environment affecting, first, the conceptualization of environmental problems and, secondly, the division of tasks with regard to those problems. As a result, not only is the social division of labor itself an ideology, but the environment in turn becomes categorized in terms of those conceptualizations. *** http://web.ku.edu/~starjrnl *** Department of Sociology, University of Kansas *** Occupations and Ideologies: A Conceptual Orientation

152	NO	0.99		Natarajan, Dilip *** Nguyen, Trung Van *** Current density and potential distribution measurements were conducted using a segmented current collector and flow field setup on membrane electrode assemblies prepared with segmented and unsegmented electrodes made from two different types of commercially available gas diffusion layers. Both galvanostatic and potentiostatic discharge modes were employed. Irrespective of the type of gas diffusion layer, when a common electrode was employed, significant performance variations were encountered between current collector segments in the constant voltage mode, while the segment to segment variations were minimal in the constant current mode. Both types of discharge modes showed negligible variations between segments in the case of segmented electrode. A simple mathematical model was developed to assist in the interpretation of the experimental results. The differences in contact resistances between the current collectors and the gas diffusion layer, especially on the cathode side have been identified as the primary reason for the experimentally observed behavior. Based on the results presented here, segmenting the electrode along with the current collector is recommended for current distribution studies. When using a common electrode, only the galvanostatic mode is preferred to minimize contact artifacts. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It examines the four possible aspectual correspondences: Russian imperfective : Czech imperfective (common), Russian perfective : Czech perfective (common), Russian imperfective : Czech perfective (frequent), and Russian perfective : Czech imperfective (infrequent). The data is argued to support the hypothesis that aspect in Czech primarily expresses a distinction in totality, whereas aspect in Russian expresses a distinction in temporal definiteness. Aspectual usage in contexts of negated repetition is also examined. The question of grounding is considered in light of the comparative data, and it is found that previous views of grounding with regard to aspect and negation can be replaced by a more nuanced sense of grounding that accommodates variation across languages. Finally, data from other Slavic languages are adduced, which indicate that the differences discussed between Czech and Russian are symptomatic of the overall east-west division in Slavic aspect established by Dickey (2000). *** Springer Verlag *** Russian language *** Czech language *** Verbal aspect *** Negation *** Grounding *** Verbal Aspect and Negation in Russian and Czech *** ?????????? ??? ? ????????? ? ??????? ? ??????? ??????

3718	NO	1.0		Lester, Cheryl *** Yetman, Norman *** Domer, Dennis *** Stone, Denise *** Bryan, Maurice *** Hofstra, Phillip G. *** Introduction In every human community, certain built forms are physical expressions of ways in which people think about their lives together. These forms express beliefs that people share about the world around them; what they expect from each other; what they hope to achieve; the standards to which they hold others responsible and the standards for which they are willing to be responsible themselves; and what they want their peers in certain endeavors and the community at large to believe about them. While homes may make these kinds of statements about individuals, the buildings that will be examined in this study are public buildings. That is, they are intended for use by people who go there regularly or periodically for purposes that they have in common - as opposed to residential buildings, which meet the private needs of individuals or families. These buildings may have occasional use for a larger number of people: a stadium or an opera house, for example. Or they may be institutions central to the way people establish and maintain a community, such as workplaces, hospitals, government facilities, and schools. Public buildings reveal a kind of consensus about what is acceptable in a building to the people who use it. Therefore, these structures - their architecture and, to an even greater extent, their interiors - are a tangible record of who the people were and what was important to them. They are also a record of how such buildings come to be built - who envisions them, who actually designs and builds them, and why. Studying a category of these kinds of public-use built environments - for instance, workplaces - is a layered inquiry that can illuminate not only building and builders, but also the society that desired the outcome and supported the effort to achieve it. In particular, examining processes and technologies as well as materials can reveal aspects of cultural systems, as Joan Vastokas observes, cultural ways - including moral and aesthetic values, art forms, social and ritual performances, as well as social structural patterns and relationships - are affected to a high degree by the dominant . . . system. The revolution in material culture studies since the 1960s has resulted in the recognition that artifacts are culturally expressive, symbolic objects. While most attention these past three decades has been paid to the meaning of the artifact in itself, there is increasing recognition that the dynamics of the technical processes in themselves play an important cognitive role in the social and ideational life of cultural systems (Vastokas 343). The flourishing of public interest in the late twentieth century in all aspects of design is testament to the way that some aspects of the technical processes of built forms can take hold in the social and ideational life of a society. In the middle of the nineteenth century in America, only a small percentage of the population could name a designer of anything, except perhaps some luxurious items, such as Sheraton furniture or Revere silver. By the close of the century, some designer names were household words, and a plethora of magazines - not only for the trade, but aimed at the general public - showcased the work of architects and interior and industrial designers. Some aspects of understanding the evolution of workplace design are more profoundly cultural recognitions, desirable to achieve simply because they help us know who we are at every level from individual to societal. In an introduction to the catalog of the National Building Museum's exhibition, On the Job: Design and the American Office, Donald Albrecht and Chrysanthe B. Broikos point out that: The office is a microcosm of American social transformation and a yardstick of cultural progress. National dialogs between freedom and control, the individual and the crowd, private agendas and public concerns, personal mobility and communal connection are played out in the office. The shifting interaction between building design, technology, finance, and employees has yielded a dynamic environment whose significance extends beyond its physical boundaries. The office has figured in American life as architecture, but it has also been on the job as an incubator of radical change (16). The beginning of the twenty-first century has permitted a useful evaluation point, looking back over a century during which work changed dramatically, putting about 60 percent of Americans at desk jobs (Jones 9) and looking ahead to work environments made increasingly fluid by the demands and opportunities of emerging technologies. The office as a dominant form in the American workplace is, as Susan Henshaw James notes, "not disappearing, but merely transforming itself, as it has always done . . . making a resurgence, retooling itself to be a place of creative interaction" (16). This period of retooling makes understanding the material culture of the office important. Understanding how and why workplaces were designed as they were can help us make judgments useful to our communities today, and they can show us continuities with the past, as well as breaks from it. Ideally, these studies can help us interpret, and perhaps even guide, human behavior. Vastokas points to these possibilities, regarding elements of theory within the method of examining "artifacts" (which, in this study, include elements of workplace interiors): Five essential points of theory arise from a consideration of artifacts in a social-semiotic perspective: (1) the meaning of artifacts, including works of visual "art," is constituted in the life of the objects themselves, not in words or texts about them; (2) the artifact is not an inert, passive object, but an interactive agent in sociocultural life and cognition; (3) the signification of the artifact resides in both the object as a self-enclosed material fact and in its performative, "gestural" patterns of behavior in relation to space, time, and society; (4) the processes, materials, and products of technology, especially those of a society's dominant technology, function as cultural metaphors at many levels and in many socio-cultural domains; and (5) theoretical insights derive, not from theorizing in the abstract, but from direct observation and experience of the phenomenal world of nature and culture (337) Because people are producers of our own built environment, studying aspects of that environment can show us a great deal about where we have been, collectively, and how we might determine where we are going. If, for example, we understand how the American workplace has evolved to its present building forms, both outside and in, when we begin to accommodate the growth of today's entrepreneurial companies into larger workplaces, those places may be more effectively designed - and the people who work there happier and more productive. Different social sectors provide examples, as well. If a house of worship helped make physical and spiritual sense of the experience of people in the prairie homesteading communities of our forebears, perhaps understanding how and why the buildings were designed as they were can help us make judgments useful to our communities today. Can they show us continuities with the past, as well as breaks from it? Can they help us interpret, and perhaps even guide, human behavior? Indeed, they can. Analyzing certain building types to these ends is often complex and difficult of course. An example that establishes this as clearly as a house of worship is a sports stadium. It's easy to see in the trends of some types of built forms the desire to recapture some elements of the past (i.e. neo-classic structures express the desire for an imagined order) or reject others (the way the clean lines of "contemporary furniture" rejected the applied decoration of furniture from earlier periods). Arguably, all built forms can be examined from this perspective, but the scope of this study focuses on interior design of the workplace in the United States after 1940, especially the work of Florence Schust Knoll Bassett and her substantial influence in two important dimensions: (1) on workplace design that had and still has the capacity to change the way occupants work; and (2) on the professional status of the people who design contemporary commercial interior spaces in America. The impact of the professional life and work of Florence Schust Knoll Bassett on the process of the professionalization of interior design is critical because that process encapsulates two other areas of inquiry that are important to understanding workplace design: one is the nature of the education of a designer, and the other is the role of gender in the design professions. Knoll Bassett's influence on the content of design education and the model she provided women in design are still observable, though rarely highlighted, today. The education of designers (in this case architects and interior designers, although the broad question of how designers are educated applies to many fields) is important because it defines the disciplines that produce built forms. And gender issues are important because interior design provides an interesting and disturbing example of what happens when gender and the process of professionalization in a discipline intersect. These areas of inquiry lead directly to the impact that professionalized interior design has had on the character of the information/service office as a workplace in America after 1945, and, thereby, its effect on contemporary American culture. Throughout this study, workplace will be taken to mean the general corporate business office environment, as differentiated from industrial production, warehousing, agricultural, institutional, retail, and hospitality-related workplaces, each of which often utilize interior design services.

305	NO	0.99		Kess, Joseph F. *** Copeland, Anita M. *** This paper deals with the structure and function of baby talk in two Nootkan languages, Ahousaht and Nitinaht. Although the baby talk registers in both of these languages appear to be simplified, it is likely that the primary function of baby talk in Nootkan is an affective one. Comparison is made between both the suppletive and non-suppletive forms in the baby talk register and the normal adult forms. Attention is called to the borrowing of baby talk terms across Northwest Coast languages, as well as to the fact that the baby talk register may be an indicator of the vitality of declining languages such as Ahousaht and Nitinaht. *** University of Kansas.

An historical analysis, utilizing anthropological accounts; Church doctrines and handbooks from the Inquisition, as well as testimonies, notes and sentences from witch trials, identifies the Church as labeler and the witch as rule-breaker. Throughout Church proclamations and convicting testimonies, there run three strands of indictment against witches: they did not worship the Christian God; they used magical powers to help or harm people; and they threatened or harmed men sexually. It is shown how these witches, many of whom were peasant healers, represented threats to the entrenchment of the Church, the legitimation of medicine as an honorable profession, and the perpetuation of patriarchal authority. It is submitted that the witch-image was created by the Christian Church, with support from secular rulers and "professional" medical practitioners, to eradicate persistent pagan religions and lay healing practices, including midwifery. This image of women as evil incarnate, and the accompanying sex oppression, has persisted through the centuries. Modem-day implications ofthe witch-image are discussed in light of the current women's culture movement. *** Department of Sociology, University of Kansas *** LABELING AND OPPRESSION: WITCHCRAFT IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE

Containers usually contain pallets; pallets contain cases; cases contain items such as pharmaceuticals and electronic goods. Passive UHF RFID has been widely used for tracking goods at the pallet and case-level. Tracking goods at each level can improve efficiency and cut supply chain costs. A practical application for passive UHF RFID is tracking large metal assets such as cargo containers. In this thesis, we present a high gain, planar microstrip antenna for low-cost RFID tagging of large metal assets. The antenna is dual-resonant and utilizes a coplanar waveguide (CPW) feed structure and matching circuit. The tag can operate over 860-930 MHz, a major portion of the 860-960 MHz frequency spectrum allocated for UHF RFID applications world-wide. We present a rigorous analysis of the antenna along with the circuit model of the antenna which will accurately predict the impedance and performance characteristics. We introduce a polarization model to predict the vertical to horizontal polarization power ratio. The analysis gives insight to the working of the antenna and the feed structure. We present measurement results and data to verify our synthesis of the antenna design. There are still open questions regarding the feed structure of the tag. We model and run several simulation models to provide a better understanding of the feed structure. *** University of Kansas *** Engineering, Electronics and Electrical *** A Dual Resonant Microstrip UHF RFID " Cargo" Tag with a CPW Structure for the Feed and Matching Circuit

V ta namen je avtorica pripravila korpus, ki zajema 895 slovenskih internacionalizmov na l- in njihovih anglekih ustreznic. Leksikalne pare je avtorica primerjala med seboj, da bi preverila, ali si izrazi ustrezajo pomensko, in sicer na konceptualni, konotacijski, kolokacijski in slogovni ravni, ter oblikovno, in sicer v morfoloki sestavi, izgovarjavi in zapisu.  Rezultati tudije so pokazali, da ima le omejeno tevilo slovensko-anglekih internacionalizmov dovolj skupnih semanti?nih, morfolokih, foneti?nih in ortografskih lastnosti, da bi jih govorci tujega jezika lahko uporabljali v skladu s pravili maternega jezika, ne da bi v drugem jeziku naredili napako.  Pri ve?ini preu?evanih leksikalnih parov je avtorica opazila razlike v pomenu, morfoloki sestavi, izgovarjavi oziroma pisavi. Pogosto so se leksikalni pari med seboj razlikovali na ve? ravneh. Pomenski lani prijatelji se lahko med seboj razlikujejo na ravni pomena, morfologije, izgovarjave in pisave. Pomenski lani prijatelji se sicer pomensko ujemajo, razlikujejo pa se v svoji morfoloki sestavi. Morfolokim razlikam se lahko pridruijo tudi razhajanja v izgovarjavi in zapisu. Glasoslovne lane prijatelje razli?no izgovarjamo, v?asih pa tudi zapisujemo, medtem ko so razlike med ortografskimi lanimi prijatelji omejene zgolj na zapis.  ?eprav so internacionalizmi del mednarodnega besedi?a, jih v sloven?ini in angle?ini ne uporabljamo na enak na?in. Navzlic temu nas navidezne podobnosti med njimi pogosto zavedejo, in sklepamo, da gre za lekseme, ki imajo enak pomen in se v jeziku podobno obnaajo, prav na podlagi taknega sklepanja pa lahko naredimo napake in se ujamemo v past lanih prijateljev.  ENGLISH: The major aim of the survey here reported was to establish whether internationalisms, words which are used internationally, may be used by Slovene and English language users as lexical items with a total meaning overlap.  For the purpose of the study, a corpus comprising 895 Slovene lexical items beginning with the letter L and their English-language counterparts was created. The lexical items in the corpus were then compared to verify their similarities in meaning, both on the conceptual, connotational, collocational and stylistic levels, and in form, both in terms of their morphological structure, pronunciation and orthography.  The study showed that only a limited number of internationalisms between Slovene and English share enough semantic, morphological, phonetic and orthographic characteristics to be used in the foreign language without falling into the trap of committing interlingual errors.  With most of the analysed lexical pairs, differences in meaning, morphological structure, pronunciation and/or spelling could be observed. Often, lexical pairs differed on more than one level. Semantic false friends, for example, may differ in meaning, morphology, pronunciation and spelling. With morphological false friends, the meanings of the lexemes are the same - the lexical pairs would differ in their morphological structure. Often, morphological differences would be accompanied by phonological and orthographical divergences as well. Finally, while with phonological false friends differences in pronunciation may be supported also by different spelling, divergences among orthographical false friends are restricted to orthography.  Although it is true that internationalisms are words which are used internationally, it has been proven that they are not used in the same way in the Slovene-English language pair. Yet, it is their apparent similarities that often lead us to believe that they share their meaning and linguistic behaviour, thus inducing us to commit interlingual errors of false-friend type. *** ZRC SAZU / Hall Center for the Humanities *** Slovene language *** Slovenian language *** Americanisms *** internationalism *** lexicography *** speech errors *** cognates *** false friends *** A Survey of Internationalisms between Slovene and English *** Internacionalizmi med sloven?ino in angle?ino

The standard Linux kernel does not provide this since application semantics do not always map onto priority based scheduling and also because when a system is under high load, applications can be aected by the high CPU contention which makes the scheduler to not choose a particular ap- plication. This thesis proposes a customized programming model that provides a flexibly configurable scheduling framework for expressing application semantics as the solution. This programming model is called the State and Control variable programming model (SCPM). State and Control variable programming model (SCPM) allows the representation of the application threads and its semantics as part of the scheduling algorithm. In order to demonstrate such a programming model, this thesis uses a video pipeline application as its driving application. *** University of Kansas *** Computer Science *** A Programming Model for Precise Computation Control satisfying Application specfic semantics

Federal agencies and states have partnered to develop nutrient-management policies and programs to reduce farm runoff. These efforts are complicated by the fact that policy decisions are made in an environment with limited resources, imperfect scientific knowledge, and diverse interests and understandings. This increases the likelihood that participants in the policy-making process will have different understandings of environmental problems and preferences for addressing them. Thus, there is a critical need for cooperation and collaboration in creating and implementing nutrient-management policies. In particular, it is important for policy makers to work collaboratively with farmers because nutrient-management policy goals cannot be achieved without their support for and full participation in policy programs. I contend that the success of nutrient-management policy efforts can be enhanced by greater knowledge of the cultural models that shape farmers' management beliefs and practices and inform their understandings of themselves and their relationship to the world. By situating policy efforts and proposals within the context of farmers' compelling cultural models, policy makers are more likely to create nutrient-management policy that farmers are willing to support and adopt. This in turn increases the likelihood that environmental goals will be achieved. A key element of this strategy is to successfully link policy ideas and practices with farmers' shared "goal-schemas" and leverage the motivational force associated with them to gain their support. To explore my contention that farmer cultural models play a central role in informing and directing their farm-management decisions, and that knowledge of these models can serve a valuable function in helping policy makers create more effective nutrient-management policies and programs, I draw on research I conducted in the Chesapeake Bay watershed with Maryland grain farmers from 1998 to 2001. The time period and focus of my research are particularly relevant to nutrient-management policy studies because they coincide with a highly contested nutrient-management policy debate in Maryland that resulted in the passage of the nation's most comprehensive environmental regulations to manage agricultural nutrient runoff. *** University of Kansas *** Anthropology, Cultural *** Agriculture, General *** Environmental Sciences *** Chesapeake Bay *** cultural models *** farming *** Maryland *** nutrient management *** water quality *** Cultural Models, Grain-Farm Management, and Agricultural Nutrient Runoff: A Maryland Case Study of the Role of Culture in Nutrient-Management Policy

In SEM it is well known that the number of free model parameters influences FP, but other facets of FP are routinely excluded from consideration. It is shown that models possessing the same number of free parameters but different structures may exhibit different FPs. The consequences of this fact are demonstrated using illustrative examples and models culled from published research. The case is made that further attention should be given to quantifying FP in SEM and considering it in model selection.

I show that the passive evolution is better understood by looking at the internal procedures that the reflexive undergoes on the way to the passive. This approach clearly recognizes that reflexive clauses with agent subjects are highly resistant to the passive interpretation, for example. A reflexive marking tends to acquire a canonical passive function when it loses the true reflexive use, and morphologically, when it becomes an affix. *** University of Kansas.

Kljub temu pa je puristi?ni odziv na te prikrite vplive odigral pomembno simboli?no vlogo s tem, da je utrdil slovensko jezikovno identiteto v zavesti slovenske jezikovne skupnosti. Besedje iz srbohrva?ine pa je povzro?alo posebne zagate slovenskim puristom, ker je v 19. stol. hrva?ina dajala sloven?ini sprejemljiva nadomestila za mednarodno in nemko abstraktno besedi?e. Pri tem pa je bilo zaradi skupnega poloaja v Jugoslaviji in izvorne bliine sloven?ine in srbohrva?ine v praksi pogosto teko z gotovostjo razlikovati slovensko gradivo od srbohrvakega. Zato je sistemati?no in nepristransko identificiranje tega gradiva ostalo naloga, s katero semorajo slovenski jezikoslovci soo?iti v obdobju politi?ne samostojnosti. Kar zadeva notranji razvoj, so puristi v?asih skuali arhaizirati in slovanizirati pravopis in oblikoslovje knjinega jezika.To je v dolo?enih jezikoslovnih krogih pospeevalo vzduje hiperkorektnosti in pikolovstva. Po drugi plati pa je struja narodoslovnega purizma, ki se za?enja z vplivno osebnostjo Jerneja Kopitarja, sluila kot protiute arhaizaciji in slovanizaciji, ker je utemeljevala normo knjine sloven?ine na sodobnih nare?jih. To osvetljuje dejstvo, da puristi?no poseganje v knjino sloven?ino lahkov glavnem ozna?imo kot zmerno in neobremenjeno s skrajnostmi. Vendar jeprav tako jasno, da bo puristi?ni spor, ki se vle?e od obdobij Trubarja, Kopitarja, ?opa in Preerna do danes, ostal pomemben dejavnik tudi v ?asu, ko se dolo?a vloga slovenskega knjinega jezika na novem drubeno-politi?nem prizori?u slovenskega jezikovnega podro?ja.   ENGLISH: Purism has played a significant role throughout the history of written Slovene. It has been directed at both external and internal threats to the language. Chief among the former have been German, the dominant language of the region, which has influenced the Slovene vernacular at all linguistic levels, and Serbo-Croatian, which served asthe de-facto idiom of inter-ethnic communication in the former Yugoslavia. Xenophobic purism has succeeded in removing most German loanwords from the standard language and replacing them with loanwords from other Slavic languages and calques. Inasmuch as the majority of the German loanwords have been retained in the spoken vernacular this has had the net effect of distancing the standard language from the respective vernacular. On the other hand, the attempt to remove the numerous syntactic and phraseological calques based on German models hasbeen generally unsuccessful in practical terms. However, the puristic reaction to these covert influences has served an important symbolic function in emphasizing a sense of Slovene linguistic identity in the linguistic consciousness of the Slovene speech community. Serbo-Croatian lexical elements, on the other hand, have posed a particularly intractable problem for Slovene purists. This was primarily because in the nineteenth century the Croatian abstract lexicon played a major part in providing standard Slovene with acceptable replacements for internationalisms and Germanisms. Secondly, because of a common involvement in Yugoslavia and the close genetic relationship between Slovene and Serbo-Croatian it was often difficult in practice to identify Serbo-Croatian material in Slovene with any degree of certainty. Indeed, a systematic, dispassionate identification of such material remains asone of the many tasks confronting Slovene scholarship in the years of political independence. Internally, purists have at various times attempted to archaize and Slavicize the orthography and morphology ofthe standard language. This has fostered a spirit of hypercorrection and pendantry in some Slovene linguistic circles. On the other hand, the strain of ethnographic purism, which goes back to the seminal figure of Jernej Kopitar, has served as an antidote to both archaization and Slavization of Slovene by seeking justification for the norms of standard Slovene in the contemporary dialects. This helps to explain why puristic intervention in standard Slovene can be generally characterized as moderate and free of excesses. Nevertheless, it is equally clear that the puristic debate, which has resounded in the times of Trubar, Kopitar, ?op, and Preeren right down to the present day, will continue to be a significant factor as the Slovene standard language seeks to define its role on the new socio-political stage of the Slovene-speaking territory. *** ZRC SAZU / Hall Center for the Humanities *** linguistic purism *** Slovene language *** Slovenian language *** South Slavic languages *** language planning *** language contact *** The Impact of Purism on the Development of the Slovene Standard Language
4601639	NO	0.99		Leidy, Heather *** Sullivan, Debra *** Beyer, Pete *** Racki, Erin Marie *** Purpose: To examine the effect of a protein-rich breakfast on appetite, food cravings, and subsequent food intake in breakfast-skipping adolescents. Methods: 15 healthy, breakfast skipping adolescents (age 14 ± 1 y; BMI 79 ± 4 %ile; breakfast 2 ± 1 occasions/wk) randomly consumed, on 3 separate days, a breakfast meal of 24% estimated daily energy needs containing the RDA for protein (18 ± 1 g protein) (PN), a higher amount of dietary protein (48 ± 2 g protein) (PR), or no breakfast (breakfast skipping, BS). Post-meal appetite and food craving responses were collected over a 4-h period followed by an ad libitum lunch buffet. Results: Following both breakfast meals, hunger was lower vs. BS (-4305 ± 1131 vs. 501 ± 1263 mm240 min; P<0.01) while fullness was greater vs. BS (4143 ± 1152 vs. 1066 ± 528 mm240 min; P<0.001). No differences were observed between meals. Both breakfast meals also led to a decrease in prospective food consumption vs. BS (-4100 ± 758 vs. 1304 ± 868 mm240 min; P<0.001). PR led to a greater reduction vs. PN (trend, P=0.06). No differences in sweet cravings were observed between breakfast meals and BS. PR and PN tended to lead to a greater reduction in salty (P=0.062) and meaty cravings (P=0.055) vs. BS; no differences were observed between meals. The PR and PN breakfast meals led to fewer calories consumed at lunch (434 ± 56 kcal) vs. BS (490 ± 63 kcal; P<0.05). PR led to 127 ± 40 fewer calories compared to 14 ± 23 more calories in PN (P<0.005). Conclusions: These findings indicate that the addition of a protein-rich breakfast beneficially impacts appetite control and food intake over the short-term and may potentially be an effective dietary strategy to re-establish energy balance and improve body weight management in overweight and obese young people *** University of Kansas *** Health Sciences, Nutrition *** Benefits of Breakfast in Adolescents

204	YES	0.99		Kim, Eun-Sook *** Nootka and Ditidaht (Nuu-chap-nulth), which belong to the Southern Wakashan branch of the Wakashan language family, exhibit complex properties with respect to glottalization. Although they have the same phoneme inventory, these two sister languages have different results in glottalization depending on manners of articulation of the affected consonant. Also, their glottalization is sensitive to morphological categories. The triggering factor of glottalization is a suffix with a glottal in its initial position, and the aspects of glottalization are different depending on the morphological category of the suffix in question, lexical or grammatical. These two properties in terms of glottalization in Nuu-chah-nulth: language variation and interaction between phonology and morphology, will he treated in Optimality Theory in this paper. *** University of Kansas.

Both the magnitude and anisotropy of gamma are found to increase as the range of the potential increases. Also we find that gamma(bcc) < gamma(fcc), consistent with recent observations that some fcc forming fluids nucleate via formation of metastable bcc nuclei. The anisotropy in gamma is also seen to be smaller in the bcc systems. By extrapolation, we also obtain an improved estimate of gamma for hard spheres. *** AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOC *** Crystal structure and interaction dependence of the crystal-melt interfacial free energy

The development of a biomimetic spinal fusion implant was motivated by two main factors. The population of patients whose metabolic conditions jeopardize the success of this surgical operation keeps increasing. Current implants and techniques present financial, technical, and health drawbacks. The new medical device would feature enhanced mechanical and electromechanical properties that would overcome these issues and could accelerate bone healing. A simple one-dimensional piezoelectric re-entrant structure was created from piezoceramic plates positioned between metallic bowtie open cells. Various sizes of this structure were prepared by hand and by a solid free-form process. These ductile cellular solids were tested to verify if they presented a nonlinear mechanical behavior at small strains along with mechanical parameters and an electromechanical behavior that could be tailored for orthopaedic applications. The tensile strength of a gradual composition material used as an interface between the metallic and ceramic elements of the structure was also evaluated. Despite the small number of specimens and limitations in the current manufacturing process, the investigations showed that the mechanical and electromechanical properties of the re-entrant structure can be controlled and tailored via their relative density. Also, the gradual composition interfacing material presented a linear change in tensile strength that could eliminate the problems of stress concentration in the structure. This work provides base data for future finite element analyses of such and evolved versions of the piezoelectric re-entrant structure. *** University of Kansas *** Engineering, Mechanical *** cellular solid *** composite *** electromechanic *** orthopaedic *** Mechanical and electromechanical characterization of a novel composite cellular solid for orthopaedic applications
