Rough docs for OAI Harvester

The OAI Harvester is derived from the OLAC Harvester, with the addition of metadata enrichment to add the features required for OLAC.
 Takes about 48 hours for the current data set.

The HasOLACType flag improves performance over a join.

Process:
* read external repositories into an OLAC MySQL database, 
* SQL scripts then extract the data into Mallet-compatible tab-delimited records in plain-text files.
* plain-text files are then checked against the classifiers:
  * [1] Binary: is it a Language-related record/article?
That data is re-combined with the original data, since some is lost in processing...

  * [2] Multi-Way: What OLAC type is it?
run-type-classifier
resource_type_extract # called indirectly, SQL-based

  * [3] Subject-language: What language is it about?


then fills out the schema.


harvest-all.sh # rebuilds all of the data by manually fetching the URLs, defaults to updating existing records

harvest-update.sh # not currently working, fetches changed records to make the data current

rebuild_full #  deletes the database tables and starts from scratch

remove_archive.sh # requires an ID, removes the data for that (item)

remove_subject_enrichments # (not used yet), removes the subject language enrichment that was added

remove_type_enrichments # deletes the added type enrichment data

reset_type_enrichments # resets HasOLACtype flag without actually deleting the data
