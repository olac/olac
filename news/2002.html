<h2><a name="olac02"></a>OLAC Workshop [12/02]</h2>

<h2><a name="wired"></a>OLAC in Wired News [11/02]</h2>

<p>
On November 4, 2002, Wired News published an article called
<i>Word Up: Keeping Languages Alive</i> which discusses OLAC
in connection with the Rosetta Project, one of our member archives.
In the article, Gary Simons is quoted as saying:
"The computing and recording technologies that are now standard tools in
doing field linguistics are changing so quickly that information captured
electronically today could cease to be accessible in another decade or two
if special care is not taken to ensure that it is archived in stable
formats by stable institutions."  (Developing recommendations in this
area will be a key focus of OLAC in 2003 - Steven Bird)
