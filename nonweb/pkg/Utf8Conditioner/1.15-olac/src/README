TITLE: README for the revised utf8conditioner package
AUTHOR: Haejoong Lee <haejoong@ldc.upenn.edu>
DATE: 2009-04-06

This is a revision of the original utf8conditional program. The source code was
taken in April 2009 from the following web page:

  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/simeon/software/utf8conditioner/
  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/simeon/software/utf8conditioner/utf8conditioner.tar.gz

According to the original README file (moved to orgdoc/README), the original
code was released on Oct 25, 2005.

The modification I made to the original package is the addition of the
utf8conditioner_unbufferred_stdou.c file and some changes to the Makefile so
that this added program is built. The added program is different from the
original one in that it does unbufferred output on the standard output. Since
its output goes to the standard output, it can act as a component in a long
unix pipe.

Other than what's described above, everything is identical to the original
package. Please read orgdoc/README for the description of the original
package.
