Each check should produce 2 lines of output.

Before beginning the check, it should print out what it does, e.g.

  Checking if database server is alive...
  Checking if web server is alive...

After checking and before exiting, it should print out "PASS" if it is checked
as expected, "FAIL" if not, or "ERROR" if the checking was impossible.
