<repositoryName>CHILDES Data repository</repositoryName>
<link>childes.talkbank.org</link>
<text>
CHILDES and TalkBank happily accept archival submissions of transcript
corpora of conversational interactions. Interactions involving young
children are included in CHILDES. Interactions involving older
children and adults are included in TalkBank. Corpora are further
divided into collections by language and interest areas (aphasia,
bilingualism, classroom, legal, etc.). All corpora must eventually be
entered in CHAT format and must pass through XML validation of this
format. In many cases, we are willing to work with contributors to
reformat their data into CHAT. Because this formatting can involve
significant work on our part, we place a priority on contributions
that include audio or video materials. However, we are interested in
including non-linked materials and materials without media when the
corpora themselves are intrinsically interesting. Guidelines for
contribution can be found at http://talkbank.org/share.

The SIL International Language and Culture Archives accepts
submissions from active and retired SIL staff in the areas of language
and culture documentation and description, and language development.
Under some circumstances, the Archives will also accept materials from
former staff and persons more casually associated with SIL language
work, if such materials relate to research done with the assistance of
SIL or its staff, and there is not a more appropriate institution able
to accept and curate the materials long-term. Please address any
questions to the Archives by sending email to archive_dallas AT
sil.org.
