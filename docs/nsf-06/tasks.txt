1. Access to Language Archive Catalogs: Improving the quality and
   quantity of conventional institutional data providers.

   OLAC has ~30 participating archives and ~30k records, but many
   archives have trivial collections of records, and many are only
   represented via static repositories set up by OLAC coordinators
   3-5 years ago.

   Year 1: Work with existing OLAC repositories to raise their report
   card score (to 4.0?); this will require that they use OLAC vocabularies.
   Set up an automatic quarterly report to be sent to curators to
   remind them about the state of their metadata, and also the level
   of interest in their archive seen via our search service.
 
   Year 2: identify major language archives with online HTML
   catalogues, and automatically map them to OLAC metadata; work with
   these archives to expose their catalogue in OLAC format
   (e.g. American Philosophical Society, National Anthropological
   Archives).

   Year 3: more of the same; plus branching out more widely than
   language archives, e.g. to national archives?

   Misc: Extend OLAC's collection level description to include the
   number items held, not just the number of metadata records.


2. Access to Language Documentation on the Web: Extending coverage
   beyond the community of participants by automated cross-walking and
   mining.

   The web contains documents in hundreds of languages; for the
   so-called low-density languages, these materials count as primary
   language documentation, and are of value to linguists.  Many
   language resources are documented in HTML on the web, e.g. the
   online catalogues of major language archives.  Linguists searching
   the web experience low precision, because Google cannot support
   community-specific semantics (e.g. "Santa Cruz" as a language
   name).  Many institutional libraries, national archives, and other
   repositories document their holdings using MARC or DC metadata.
   Linguists experience low recall for these materials, because many
   of these repositories are not indexed by Google.

   Year 1: Build an OAI-DC to OLAC crosswalk, and discover language
   resources in OAI repositories for indexing by OLAC.  Automatically
   detect language id, and other OLAC terms.  (This will quickly
   enlarge the content of OLAC, and give us more pulling power for
   task 1 year 2.)

   Year 2: Build a MARC-OLAC crosswalk, and discover language
   resources via Z39.50 for indexing by OLAC.  This will cover
   the world's major libraries and archives.

   Year 3: (but could start earlier) mine the web for low-density
   language materials and cache them, document the materials in OLAC
   metadata (overlap with LangGator); generate static HTML pages for
   all metadata, for indexing by search engines, to facilitate
   resource discovery.

3. Access to Digital Content: Curating new digital language resources
   (both inside and outside the community) through language-aware
   institutional repositories.

   Most searches for language resources do not lead to an online
   version of the resource.  Instead it is usually necessary to visit
   an archive or contact an author.  Many sponsored language
   documentation projects create resources that only reside in the
   investigator's computer.  There is some consensus about what
   comprises the inventory of basic documentation for a language
   (e.g. EMELD and Rosetta index pages for a language), but this
   should be broadened.

   Year 1: Create an ISO 639-3 module for DSpace, including a flexible
   browser for 7000+ languages, with geographical, genetic, historical
   navigation, and support for maintenance of the vocabulary over
   time.  Set up a DSpace sandbox at the LDC, with user accounts, to
   permit the community to interact with the repository and give
   feedback.  (Also: promote ISO 639-3 to library community at large,
   e.g. JCDL, RLG, ASA)

   Year 2: Create an OLAC module for DSpace, and expand the DSpace
   sandbox at LDC.

   Year 3: deliverable - downloadable package with DSpace plus OLAC module.

   Misc:

   DSpace: link the language homepages in different DSpace instances, by
   including OLAC search functionality inside DSpace?; set up a
   language documentation template?

   OLAC Score Cards - rank archives on accessibility of digital
     content, and other best practices (cf OAIS).

   Language identification: Promote ISO 639-3 to DCMI; once adopted
     encourage downstream adoption by DSpace, OAI, etc.

   DCMI: promote OLAC as a DC application profile, to encourage wider
     usage of OLAC vocabularies.
