Goal 1: Access to Language Archive Catalogs: Improving the quality and
quantity of conventional institutional data providers.

OLAC has ~30 participating archives and ~30k records, but many
archives have trivial collections of records, and many are only
represented via static repositories set up by OLAC coordinators 3-5
years ago.

Task 1.1: Improve the quality of existing OLAC repositories

+ background: report cards, as a performance incentive
+ background: we have an OLAC metadata usage page that shows what
    vocabulary items are in use
+ background: query logs; scale of query interest; precision/recall issues
+ task: identify low-scoring archives, and work with them to
    improve the quality of their metadata, particularly the
    use of OLAC vocabularies; map vocabulary items; identify synonyms etc
+ task: develop an OLAC usage document based on this experience
+ task: analyze query logs to see what
+ task: automatic quarterly report to be sent to curators to remind
    them about the state of their metadata, and the top queries
    pertaining to their archives.
 
Task 1.2: Improve the quantity of OLAC repositories

+ background: tailing off of new additions
+ background: large archives still not participating (APA, NAA)
+ task: automatic scraping of HTML metadata, to show archivists
    their search results coming up; motivate them to improve precision
    and recall by mapping their terms to OLAC terms
+ task: work with these archives to expose their catalogue in OLAC format

Task 1.3: Improve the archival credibility of OLAC repositories

+ background: many so-called archives are not credible archives at all
+ task: refine OLAC's collection level description to include
    more fine-grained categorization of OLAC; where this is vetted
    by OLAC against published criteria (derived from OAIS reference model)
+ task: incorporate criteria into scorecard

Misc: Extend OLAC's collection level description to include the number
items held, not just the number of metadata records.

Goal 2: Access to Language Documentation on the Web: Extending
coverage beyond the community of participants by automated
cross-walking and mining.

The web contains documents in hundreds of languages; for the so-called
low-density languages, these materials count as primary language
documentation, and are of value to linguists.  Many language resources
are documented in HTML on the web, e.g. the online catalogues of major
language archives.  Linguists searching the web experience low
precision, because Google cannot support community-specific semantics
(e.g. "Santa Cruz" as a language name).  Many institutional libraries,
national archives, and other repositories document their holdings
using MARC or DC metadata.  Linguists experience low recall for these
materials, because many of these repositories are not indexed by
Google.

Task 2.1: Build an OAI-DC to OLAC crosswalk, and discover language
resources in OAI repositories for indexing by OLAC.  Automatically
detect language id, and other OLAC terms.  (This will quickly enlarge
the content of OLAC, and give us more pulling power for task 1 year
2.)

Task 2.2: Build a MARC-OLAC crosswalk, and discover language resources
via Z39.50 for indexing by OLAC.  This will cover the world's major
libraries and archives.

Task 2.3: (but could start earlier) mine the web for low-density
language materials and cache them, document the materials in OLAC
metadata (overlap with LangGator); generate static HTML pages for all
metadata, for indexing by search engines, to facilitate resource
discovery.

Goal 3: Access to Digital Content: Curating new digital language
resources (both inside and outside the community) through
language-aware institutional repositories.

Most searches for language resources do not lead to an online version
of the resource.  Instead it is usually necessary to visit an archive
or contact an author.  Many sponsored language documentation projects
create resources that only reside in the investigator's computer.
There is some consensus about what comprises the inventory of basic
documentation for a language (e.g. EMELD and Rosetta index pages for a
language), but this should be broadened.

Task 3.1: Create DSpace modules to support language identification and
linguistic data.

* 3.1.1. Create an ISO 639-3 module for DSpace, including a flexible
browser for 7000+ languages, with geographical, genetic, historical
navigation, and support for maintenance of the vocabulary over time.

* 3.1.2. Add support for the ingest of best practice formats.

* 3.1.3. Set up a DSpace sandbox at the LDC, with user accounts, to permit the
community to interact with the repository and give feedback.

* 3.1.4. Promote ISO 639-3 to library community at large, e.g. JCDL,
RLG, ASA

Task 3.2: Create an OLAC module for DSpace, and expand the DSpace
sandbox at LDC.

Task 3.3: Support off-line ingest via DSpace, permitting a field
linguist to prepare a SIP (including OLAC metadata) to be uploaded to
an institutional repository once the user has internet access.  Make
this into a downloadable package (including XML editor, stylesheets,
schemas, and configuration files).

Misc tasks not yet incorporated

DSpace: link the language homepages in different DSpace instances, by
including OLAC search functionality inside DSpace?; set up a language
documentation template?

OLAC Score Cards - rank archives on accessibility of digital content,
and other best practices (cf OAIS).

Language identification: Promote ISO 639-3 to DCMI; once adopted
encourage downstream adoption by DSpace, OAI, etc.

DCMI: promote OLAC as a DC application profile, to encourage wider
usage of OLAC vocabularies.
