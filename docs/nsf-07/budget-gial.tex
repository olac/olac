Staff at the Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics (GIAL) will
collaborate with University of Pennsylvania staff in pursuit of the
objectives laid out in the proposal narrative.
Staffing at GIAL will consist of a principal investigator (Simons)
and a graduate research assistant.  They will carry out the tasks
detailed below.

A1 & Simons & 1 month/year &
Simons will direct the work of the GRA and collaborate with Bird
on the design of new technologies for deployment on the OLAC site.\\

B3 & Graduate Research Assistant & half-time, years 1, 2, 3 &
The GRA will be a student who is pursuing a Masters degree (in 
applied linguistics or language development) and who has a good grasp of web technologies and
metadata concepts. One focus of activity will be
the tasks under Objective 1 that involve personal interaction
with actual and potential OLAC participants.  This will include
working with current OLAC participants to improve the quality of their
metadata (Outcome 1.1), identifying potential participants and advising
them through the process of developing a metadata repository and registering with
OLAC (Outcome 1.2), and working with participating archives to document
and improve their digital archiving parctices (Outcome 1.3). 
Another focus of activity will be to participate
in the development of best practice recommendations and in
writing and presenting conference papers 
that disseminate the results of the project.\\

E1 & Domestic travel & 4000, years 1, 2, 3 &
The Co-PI and GRA will attend two conferences each year in digital archives or
language resources, to disseminate the results of our research as
widely as possible.\\

G1 & Materials and supplies & 1200, year 1; 400, years 2, 3 &
The larger amount in the first year will enable us
to equip the GRA with a workstation.  The budget in the remaining years
will cover software upgrades and incidental supplies.\\
