Dear Community,

Here is a summary of the developments in the Open Language Archives
Community over the last couple of years.  Full details are available at:

OLAC SERVICES

You can use OLAC's online services to search language archives, and to
register your own collection of language resources.

LSA TUTORIAL

Jeff Good (Buffalo) and Heidi Johnson (UT Austin) organized a
tutorial titled "Accessing Collaboration: Archives as Bridges between
Researchers, Resources and Communities of Speakers",
at the LSA Conference in San Francisco in January.

FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION AND CONSERVATION

This conference will be of interest to many members of the language
archiving community.  It will take place in Hawaii in March 2009,
and OLAC will be presented in one of the sessions.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF OLAC SEARCH

Over the past year we have been developing tools and recommendations designed
to improve the quality of language resource metadata, since more detailed
and accurate metadata will greatly improve the quality of OLAC search.
The Archive Metrics page scores participating archives according to the
quality of their metadata [http://www.language-archives.org/metrics/].
It assesses quality according to an extensive set of recommendations
and guidelines.

GOOGLE INDEXING

OLAC services check the ~35 registered archives for updates three
times a day, and update the index used by OLAC's search service.
In addition, a web page is created for every archived item, e.g.
http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:aseda.aiatsis.gov.au:0020
Google indexes these ~30,000 pages, so people searching for
language resources may discover items in any OLAC archive, e.g.
http://www.google.com/search?q=kaytetye+texts
If an item is described using an ISO 639-3 or OLAC term,
these are added to the item page, e.g. iso639_gbb, olac_lexicon,
and you can search for them using Google:
http://www.google.com/search?q=olac_lexicon&filter=0


OLAC 1.1 METADATA

Version 1.0 of OLAC metadata has been around since 2002 and there has
been an extended period of stability during which archives have been
able to develop and operate their interfaces to OLAC.  Now that
ISO 639-3 has been formally adopted and the set of language codes
has been revised, we have reflected this in OLAC metadata
(after all, accurate language identification is the cornerstone
the OLAC enterprise.)  As part of this change we have improved the
top-level description of OLAC repositories, to permit an archive's
submission policy to be documented, and to permit more flexible
identification of archive administrators, with input from the
OLAC community.  These changes have led to the development of
version 1.1 of the OLAC metadata schema and the OLAC archive
description schema, described in updated versions of the OLAC
standards:

OLAC IN THE PACIFIC

In 2008 and 2009, OLAC is being presented at three conferences
in the Pacific: IASA (Australia), PACLIC (Philippines), ICLDC
(Hawaii).  We have a paper in the PACLIC proceedings; presentation
materials are posted on the OLAC site.
