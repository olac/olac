         <heading>Introduction</heading>
         <p>&lt;oXygen/&gt; is a full-featured cross-platform XML editor (for Windows, Mac OS
            X, Linux and Eclipse) providing the tools needed
            for XML authoring and application development <cit>oXygen</cit>. It is a mature product (now in
            its Version 9.0 release) that is popular among academics due to its
            easy-to-obtain
            academic license that is priced well under $100 <cit>oXygen-Academic</cit>.
            The fully functional product may be downloaded and freely used for a 30-day
            evaluation period <cit>oXygen-Download</cit>.</p>
          <p>This document describes how this product can be used to create and validate a
          static repository of language resource descriptions that complies with the
             <cit>OLAC-Repositories</cit> standard. Section 2 describes additional steps
             that must be done after installation in order to configure &lt;oXygen/&gt; to
             work with OLAC metadata. Those who 
             create a static repository by running a script over an existing data source
             do not need a tool like &lt;oXygen/&gt; for creating the repository, but they
             do need a tool for validating the output of their script. Section 3 describes how &lt;oXygen/&gt; can then be used to
             validate an OLAC static repository. Finally, section 4 describes how it can
             also be used to create and maintain a static repository as an original data
             source. </p>

         <heading>Installation</heading>
         <p>Download the software for the appropriate platform from
            <cit>oXygen-Download</cit> and follow the installation instructions provided
            on that page. An additional step must be taken in order to configure
            &lt;oXygen/&gt; for use with OLAC metadata. This is to install the XSV (XML Schema Validator)
            packjage.
         </p>
         <p>The schema validator that is built into &lt;oXygen/&gt; is Xerces, but
            it is known to fail (incorrectly) with the XML schemas for Qualified Dublin
            Core <cit>DC-Notes</cit>. Consequently, the default installation of
            &lt;oXygen/&gt; is not able to validate an OLAC static repository. However,
            the XSV package does work correctly with the Dublin Core and OLAC schemas and
            &lt;oXygen/&gt; is pre-configured to work with XSV once it is installed.
            Download and install the appropriate distribution of XSV:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><p>Windows: Download and execute
               <url>ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/XSV/XSV210.EXE</url>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Linux: Download 
               <url>ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/XSV/XSV-2.10-1.noarch.rpm</url> and
               install with <tt>rpm</tt>.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>The executable path is pre-configured  in &lt;oXygen/&gt; for 
            <tt>[oXygen-install-dir]/xsv</tt> as the installation
            directory (for instance, in a Windows
            installation, <tt>C:\Program Files\Oxygen XML Editor 9.0\xsv</tt>). If it is installed in a different
            directory the predefined executable path must be corrected in Options /
            Preferences / Editor / Custom Validation. </p>
         <p>It is necessary to close and restart &lt;oXygen/&gt; for the installation of
            XSV to take effect.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <heading>Validating a repository</heading>
         <p><i>In the &lt;oXygen/&gt; toolbar, following "External Tools", is the Custom
            Validation button.  It says LIBXML by default. Click on the drop-down control
            to the right of the button and select XSV.  The button should now say XSV;
            clicking the button will invoke XSV schema validation on the current document.</i> </p>
         <p>Use File / Open or File / Open URL to open the static repository that you wish
         to validate. For instance, a sample repository is at the following URL:</p>
         <blockquote><p><url>http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/static-repository.xml</url></p></blockquote>
         <p>Click on the XSV button to perform schema validation. It is not necessary to
            load the XML schemas since the <i>schemaLocation</i> attribute in the root
            element tells the validator where to find all the needed schemas. Be patient
            since the validation process may take  up to a minute. If the final line in
            the message pane says <tt>"[XSV] Validation successful"</tt> then the
            repository is valid. Otherwise, the last message will describe an error. 
            Double-click it to jump to the offending spot in the repository. Fix the error
            and revalidate.
