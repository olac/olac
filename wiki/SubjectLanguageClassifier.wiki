#summary Plans and progress on developing a subject language classifier

= Introduction =

The basic idea of the subject language classifier is described in the page on [Enrichment] strategy. This page tracks plans and design options and progress toward completing the classifier.

= Training data =

The classifier looks for words and phrases that are language names or other names that are associated with languages (like countries, places, subgroups) and then performs logic over the name strings that are found in order to propose likely subject languages. The classifier is thus trained with facts that are triples consisting of a name string, the kind of name it is, and the code for the language it is associated with. The format for the data used to train the classifier is described elsewhere in   [iso639_trainerDatafileFormat].

In order to support long-term maintenance of this knowledge base, the facts derived from different sources of information are kept in separate files so that they can be managed independently.  When a new version of an information source comes out, the data file for it can be completely regenerated and the all the data reloaded into the classifier. Data files from the following sources are planned:

  * Ethnologue for living language names, alternate names, dialect names, region information, countries, classification
  * Linguist List (http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/GetListOfAncientLgs.html) for ancient language names, region information, classification
  * ISO 639-3 Names table (http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/download.asp) to get some additional names not in above two (including some French names and constructed language names)
  * LCSH language names (compiled by our project)
  * ISO 3166 codes and country names (CountryCodes table from http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/) 
  * Scrape historical country names from http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/hist_country_names.htm
  * Following http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country to all of the pages for individual countries we can find the country name in multiple languages as the value of the rdfs:label property
  * The Getty Thesaurus of Geographical Names (http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/index.html) has multiple current and historical names for countries, but it is not clear that we can automate anything here. This may need to be perused manually at the end to find significant names that are missing.
  * A running list of facts we add as we note striking omissions from the above sources

The files will unavoidably contain duplicate facts. Thus the data loader must note and ignore duplicates.
