# Specification for the short citation string for an item

= Objective =

On the language index pages (and no doubt elsewhere), we need a short citation form for an item so that a user can skim the list of resources to spot ones of interest which can be inspected in full via a link to the /item page.

= Details =

1a. the text content of all creator elements separated by semicolon
1b. if there's no creator element, the text content of all contributor
elements separated by semicolon
2. the DC dumbed-down date following section 1 of
http://olac.wiki.sourceforge.net/Display+format+and+DC+crosswalk
3. the text content of the first publisher field if it exists
