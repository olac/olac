=Implementation notes for task 2.1a, _"Language identification"_=

Develop an automated procedure for finding language identification in a catalog record and translating it to an appropriate ISO 639-3 code.<br>

The following are rough notes. Eventually this needs to be developed into a full specification:
 * store a table that maps record identifiers to 3-letter codes
 * use an outer join with a fixed value field so we know the code was guessed, and show this on the item page
 * for oai_dc output include a provenance note indicating both sources (provider, OLAC) and specify the vocabularies where we're inferring the coded value (but don't try to communicate this information inside the DC record itself)
 * link to the item from the OLAC page for this language there should be an indication of uncertainty
