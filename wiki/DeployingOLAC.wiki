= Details =

== The machine ==

Created a vm on a vmware server with 4 CPU/2GB RAM/250GB HDD. The architecture of the machine is i686. The virtual HDD was created on a NFS storage.

== The OS ==

=== Installation ===
Debian 5.0.3 was chosen because we were told that Debian as a server is more stable than Ubuntu by a system administrator.

Created one partition without a swap partition. A swap file will be added later instead.

Created a user account olac (OLAC System Admin). This account will be used for doing things that are needed to be done as a root.

For software configuration, the followings were checked.

 * Web server
 * SQL server (this was a mistake since it installed postgresql instead of mysql)
 * Standard machine

=== Configuration 1 ===
In order to make olac a sudoer, installed sudo by running "apt-get install sudo" as a root user.

Run visudo to edit /etc/sudoers file. Add a line at the end: "olac ALL=(ALL) ALL". We are giving full privileges for now, but this can be changed later.
